{"page": 10, "text": "Foreword\nI\nremember the first week of my career as a VC. I was 25 years\nold, it was 1986, and I had just landed a summer job in a venture\ncapital firm. I was working for three experienced venture capitalists\nin a small firm called Euclid Partners, where I ended up spending\nthe first 10 years of my VC career. One of those three partners,\nBliss McCrum, peeked his head into my office (I had an office in\nRockefeller Center at age 25) and said to me, “Can you model out\na financing for XYZ Company at a $9 million pre-money, raising\n$3 million, with an unissued option pool of 10%?” and then went\nback to the big office in the rear he shared with the other founding\npartner, Milton Pappas.\nI sat at my desk and started thinking about the request. I\nunderstood the “raising $3 million” bit. I thought I could figure\nout the “unissued option pool of 10%” bit. But what the hell was\n“pre-money”? I had never heard that term. This was almost a decade\nbefore Netscape and Internet search so searching online for it wasn’t\nan option. After spending ten minutes getting up the courage, I\nwalked back to that big office, peeked my head in, and said to Bliss,\n“Can you explain pre-money to me?”\nThus began my 31-year education in venture capital that is still\ngoing on as I write this.\nThe venture capital business was a cottage industry back in 1985,\nwith club deals and a language all of its own. A cynic would say it was\ndesigned this way to be opaque to everyone other than the VCs so that\nthey would have all the leverage in negotiations with entrepreneurs.\nI don’t entirely buy that narrative. I think the VC business grew up in\na few small offices in Boston, New York, and San Francisco, and the\ndozens—maybe as many as a hundred—of main participants, along\nxiii"}

I was joined in this blogging thing by Brad Feld, a\nfriend and frequent coinvestor. Club investing has not gone away\nand that’s a good thing. By reading AVC and Feld Thoughts regu-\nlarly, an entrepreneur could get up to speed on startups and venture\ncapital. Brad and I received a tremendous amount of positive feed-\nback on our efforts to bring transparency to the venture capital busi-\nness so we kept doing it, and now if you search for something like\n“participating preferred” you will find posts written by both me and\nBrad on that first search results page.\nBrad and his partner Jason Mendelson (a recovering startup law-\nyer turned VC) took things a step further and wrote a book called\nVenture Deals back in 2011. It has turned into a classic and is now on\nits Third Edition. If Venture Deals had been around in 1985, I would\nnot have had to admit to Bliss that I had no idea what pre-money\nmeant.\nIf there is a guidebook to navigating the mysterious and confusing\nlanguage of venture capital and venture capital financing structures,\nit is Venture Deals. Anyone interested in startups, entrepreneurship,\nand angel and venture capital financings should do themselves a\nfavor and read it.\nFred Wilson\nUSV Partner\nJuly 2016"}
{"page": 12, "text": "Foreword\nI\nremember the first time I saw the exit sign for Sand Hill Road\noff of Highway 280. It was 1999. I was 22 years old, had just dropped\nout of Harvard, and was the cofounder and CTO of a startup based\nin Boston. My cofounder and I decided to cast the net wide in our\nsearch for money and flew out to Silicon Valley to meet with VCs.\nAs I saw the exit for Sand Hill Road, I started to feel incredibly ner-\nvous and unwell. I immediately noticed the telltale signs of a distinct\nlack of preparation and knowledge. I felt this way if I hadn't stud-\nied thoroughly for a test in school. In high school, right before a\ncross-country race, I felt this way if I hadn't put in enough miles of\nrunning in practice. By this time, hadn't I learned my lesson about\npreparation and its effect on my digestive system? Why did I show up\nto such important meetings so uninformed about the people and\nthe industry from whom I was trying to raise money from? Well, in\n1999, it wasn't so easy for a 22-year-old first-time entrepreneur to\nfigure all of this out.\nWe did succeed in raising money for that startup, but due to\nour own mistakes and the tough environment at the time, we ended\nup closing our doors a couple of years later. However, I made a\ncouple of great friends, Eric and Gokhan, from that startup, and\nwe picked ourselves up and immediately started another company\ncalled Windup Labs. After four years of incredibly hard work, we\nsold Windup to CNET Networks (now part of CBS Interactive) in\n2005, and as part of the acquisition, we all moved to San Francisco.\nIn 2007, Eric and I left CNET to start Fitbit. Eric and I started\noff with fairly modest ambitions for the company, but as the years\npassed, our ambitions grew. From 2007 to today, the company\ngrew to over 1,500 employees, and our most recent guidance to\nxv"}

In 2015, Fitbit went public, raising over\n$800 million in the largest-ever consumer electronics initial public\noffering (IPO) in history. I've remained its CEO from founding to\ntoday.\nAs I read this book, I was amazed at how succinctly it captured\nthe sum of my 16 years of experience raising money, dealing, and\nworking with VCs and corporate lawyers. I wish I could travel back\nin time and hand this book off to my nervous and ill 22-year-old self\n(along with an iPhone and the idea for Facebook).\nYou, the reader, have gotten a huge bargain. After finishing this\nbook, you will have skipped years of painful experience, trial and\nerror, and learning on the clock from expensive lawyers. This is the\nbusiness book equivalent of Neo jacking in and learning kung fu in\nan instant in The Matrix. As you find yourself driving down 280 (or,\ndepending on how long this foreword lasts, being whisked in your\nautonomous electric car) and the sign for Sand Hill Road comes\ninto view, feel confident that you've been prepared by some of the\nbest VCs I know.\nJames Park\nFitbit Cofounder and CEO\nJuly 2016"}
{"page": 14, "text": "Preface\nO\nne of the ways to finance a company is to raise venture capital.\nWhile only a small percentage of companies raise venture capital,\nmany of the great technology companies that have been created,\nincluding Google, Apple, Cisco Systems, Yahoo!, Netscape, Sun\nMicrosystems, Compaq, Digital Equipment Corporation, and\nAmerica Online (AOL) raised venture capital early in their lives.\nSome of today’s fastest-growing entrepreneurial companies, such\nas Facebook, Twitter, Airbnb, LinkedIn, Fitbit, and Uber were also\nrecipients of venture capital.\nOver the past 20 years we’ve been involved in hundreds of\nventure capital financings. A decade ago, after a particularly\nchallenging financing, we decided to write a series of blog posts that\nwould demystify the venture capital financing process. The result\nwas the Term Sheet Series on Brad’s blog (www.feld.com/archives/\ncategory/term-sheet), which was the inspiration for this book.\nAs each new generation of entrepreneurs emerges, there is a\nrenewed interest in how venture capital deals come together. We\nencounter many of these first-time entrepreneurs through our activities\nas venture capitalists at our firm Foundry Group (www.foundrygroup\n.com), as well as our involvement in Techstars (www.techstars.com).\nWe have been regularly reminded that there is no definitive guide to\nventure capital deals and as a result set out to create one.\nIn addition to describing venture capital deals in depth, we’ve\ntried to create context around the players, the deal dynamics,\nand how venture capital funds work. We’ve tossed in a section on\nnegotiation, if only to provide another viewpoint into the brains of\nhow a venture capitalist (at least the two of us) might think about\nnegotiation. We also took on explaining the other term sheet that\nxvii"}

As early-stage\ninvestors, we know we are biased toward an early-stage perspective,\nbut we try to provide context that will apply to any financing stage.\nWe’ve also tried to make fun of lawyers any chance we get.\nWe hope you find this book useful in your quest to create a great\ncompany.\nAudience\nWhen we first conceived this book, we planned to target it at first-\ntime entrepreneurs. We both have a long history of funding and\nworking with first-time entrepreneurs and often learn more from\nthem than they learn from us. Through our involvement in Tech-\nstars, we’ve heard a wide range of questions about financings and\nventure capital from first-time entrepreneurs. We’ve tried to do a\ncomprehensive job of addressing those questions in this book.\nAs we wrote the book, we realized it was also useful for expe-\nrienced entrepreneurs. A number of the entrepreneurs who read\nearly drafts or heard about what we were writing gave us feedback\nthat they wished a book like this had existed when they were start-\ning their first company. When we asked the question, “Would this be\nuseful for you today?” many said, “Yes, absolutely.” Several sections,\nincluding the ones on negotiation and how venture capital funds\nwork, were inspired by long dinner conversations with experienced\nentrepreneurs who told us that we had to write this stuff down, either\non our blog or in a book. Well—here it is!\nOf course, before one becomes a first-time entrepreneur, one\nis often an aspiring entrepreneur. This book is equally relevant\nfor the aspiring entrepreneur of whatever age. In addition, any-\none in school who is interested in entrepreneurship—whether\nin business school, law school, an undergraduate program, or\nan advanced degree program—should benefit from this book.\nWe’ve both taught many classes on various topics covered in this\nbook and hope this becomes standard reading for any class on\nentrepreneurship.\nWe were once inexperienced venture capitalists. We learned\nmostly by paying attention to more experienced venture capitalists, as"}

We hope this book becomes another\ntool in the tool chest for any young or aspiring venture capitalist.\nWhile we’ve aimed the book at entrepreneurs, we hope that even\nlawyers (especially those who don’t have much experience doing ven-\nture capital deals) and experienced venture capitalists will benefit from\nus putting these thoughts down in one place. At the minimum, we\nhope they recommend the book to their less experienced colleagues.\nFinally, unintended beneficiaries of this book are the spouses\nof venture capitalists, lawyers, and entrepreneurs, especially those\nentrepreneurs actively involved in a deal. While Brad’s wife, Amy, is\nquick to say, “Everything I’ve learned about venture came from over-\nhearing your phone calls,” we hope other spouses can dip into this\nbook every now and then. This can be especially useful when your\nentrepreneurial life partner some empathy while complaining about\nhow a venture capitalist is trying to sneak a participating preferred\ninto a round.\nOverview of the Contents\nWe start off with a brief history of the venture capital term sheet\nand a discussion of the different parties who participate in venture\ncapital transactions.\nWe then discuss how to raise money from a venture capitalist,\nincluding determining how much money an entrepreneur should raise\nand what types of materials one will need before hitting the fundrais-\ning trail. Included in this section is a discussion about the process that\nmany venture capitalists follow to decide which companies to fund.\nWe then dive deeply into the particular terms that are included\nin venture capital term sheets. We’ve separated this into three\nchapters—terms related to economics, terms related to control,\nand all of the other terms. We strive to give a balanced view of the\nparticular terms along with strategies to getting to a fair deal.\nFollowing the chapters on terms, we discuss how convertible\ndebt works and the pros and cons versus raising equity.\nWe’ve introduced a new section in this edition about crowdfund-\ning, how it differs from traditional venture capital deals, and how we\nthink the crowdfunding ecosystem will affect venture capital.\nWe then go into a frank discussion about how venture capital\nfirms operate, including how venture capitalists are motivated and\ncompensated. We then discuss how these structural realities can"}

We\nalso attempt to help the entrepreneur learn ways to consummate a\ntransaction in a venture capital financing while avoiding common\nmistakes and pitfalls.\nSince there is no such thing as a standard venture capital\nfinancing, we cover different issues to consider that depend on the\nstage of financing a company is raising. We also discuss some of the\ntheories behind why any of these documents even exist so that you\ncan understand the hidden incentives in the process.\nAs a bonus, we’ve tossed in a chapter about the other impor-\ntant term sheet that entrepreneurs need to know about: the letter of\nintent to acquire your company.\nFinally, we end with why term sheets even exist in the first place\nalong with tips concerning several common legal issues that most\nstartups face. While not a dissertation on everything an entrepre-\nneur needs to know, we’ve tried to include a few important things\nthat we think entrepreneurs should pay attention to.\nThroughout the book we’ve enlisted a close friend and longtime\nentrepreneur, Matt Blumberg, the CEO of Return Path, to add his\nperspective. Whenever you see a sidebar titled “The Entrepreneur’s\nPerspective,” these are comments from Matt on the previous section.\nAdditional Materials\nAlong with this book, we’ve created some additional materials that\nyou may want to review.

In 1957, American Research and\nDevelopment Corporation (AR&D), one of the first venture capital\nfirms, invested $70,000 in DEC. When DEC went public in 1968, this\ninvestment was worth over $355 million, or a return of over 5,000\ntimes the invested capital. AR&D’s investment in DEC was one of the\noriginal venture capital home runs.\nIn 1957, the venture capital industry was just being created. At the\ntime, the investor community in the United States was uninterested\nin investing in computer companies, as the last wave of computer-\nrelated startups had performed poorly and even large companies\nwere having difficulty making money in the computer business. We\ncan envision the frustration of DEC’s cofounders, Ken Olson and\nHarlan Anderson, as the investors they talked to rejected them\nand their fledgling idea for a business. We can also imagine their\njoy when Georges Doriot, the founder of American Research and\nDevelopment Corporation, offered to fund them. After a number\nof conversations and meetings, Doriot sent Olson and Anderson a\nletter expressing his interest in investing, along with his proposed\nterms. Today, this document is called the term sheet.\nNow, imagine what that term sheet looked like. There are three\ndifferent possibilities. The first is that it was a typed one-page let-\nter that said, “We would like to invest $70,000 in your company\nand buy 78 percent of it.” The next is that it was two pages of legal\nterms that basically said, “We would like to invest $70,000 in your\ncompany and buy 78 percent of it.” Or it could have been an eight-\npage typed document that had all kinds of protective provisions, vesting\n1"}
{"page": 23, "text": "2 Venture Deals\narrangements, drag-along rights, and Securities and Exchange Com-\nmission (SEC) registration rights.\nOur guess is that it was not the third option. Over the past 50\nyears, the art of the term sheet has evolved and expanded, reaching\nits current eight (or so) page literary masterpiece. These eight pages\ncontain a lot more than “We’d like to invest $X in your company\nand get Y% of it,” but, as you’ll learn, there really are only two key\nthings that matter in the actual term sheet negotiation—economics\nand control.\nIn DEC’s case, by owning 78% of the company, AR&D effec-\ntively had control of the company. And the price was clearly\ndefined—$70,000 bought 78% of the company, resulting in a $90,000\npost-money valuation.\nToday’s venture capital investments have many more nuances.\nIndividual venture capitalists (VCs) usually end up owning less than\n50 percent of the company, so they don’t have effective voting con-\ntrol but often negotiate provisions that give them control over major\ndecisions by the company. Many companies end up with multiple\nventure capitalists who invest in the company at different points in\ntime, resulting in different ownership percentages, varying rights,\nand diverging motivations. Founders don’t always stay with the com-\npany through the exit and, in some cases, they end up leaving rela-\ntively early in the life of a company for a variety of reasons. Compa-\nnies fail, so venture capitalists have gotten much more focused on\nprotecting themselves for the downside as well as participating in the\nupside. Governance issues are always complex, especially when you\nhave a lot of people sitting around the negotiating table.\nWhile it would be desirable to do venture capital deals with a\nsimple agreement on price, a handshake, and a short legal agree-\nment, this rarely happens. And while there have been plenty of\nattempts to standardize the term sheet over the years, the prolifera-\ntion of lawyers, venture capitalists, and entrepreneurs, along with a\nsteadily increasing number of investments, has prevented this from\nhappening. Ironically, the actual definitive documents have become\nmore standard over time. Whether it is the Internet age that has\nspread information across the ecosystem or clients growing tired of\npaying legal bills, there are more similarities in the documents today\nthan ever before. As a result, we can lend you our experience in how\nventure financings are usually done. The good news is once you’ve"}

Any\nentrepreneur who has created a company that has gone through\nmultiple financings knows that the number of people involved can\nquickly spiral out of control, especially if you aren’t sure who actually\nis making the decisions at each step along the way.\nThe experience, motivation, and relative power of each partici-\npant in a financing can be complex, and the implications are often\nmysterious. Let’s begin our journey to understanding venture capi-\ntal financings by making sure we understand each player and the\ndynamics surrounding the participants.\nThe Entrepreneur\nNot all investors (and bankers and lawyers, for that matter) realize it,\nbut the entrepreneur is the center of the entrepreneurial universe.\nWithout entrepreneurs there would be no term sheet and no startup\necosystem.\nThroughout this book we use the words entrepreneur and founder\ninterchangeably. While some companies have only one founder,\nmany have two, three, or even more. Sometimes these cofounders\nare equals; other times they aren’t. Regardless of the number, they\neach have a key role in the formation of the company and any financ-\ning that occurs.\n5"}
{"page": 26, "text": "6 Venture Deals\nThe founders can’t and shouldn’t outsource their involvement\nin a financing to their lawyers. There are many issues in a financing\nnegotiation that only the entrepreneurs can resolve. Even if you hire\na fantastic lawyer who knows everything, don’t forget that if your\nlawyer and your future investors don’t get along, you will have larger\nissues to deal with, as the way your lawyer represents himself will\ndirectly reflect on you. If you are the entrepreneur, make sure you\ndirect and control the process.\nThe relationship between the founders at the beginning of the\nlife of a company is almost always good. If it’s not, the term sheet and\ncorresponding financing are probably the least of the founders’ wor-\nries. However, as time passes, the relationship between cofounders\noften frays. This could be due to many different factors: the stress of\nthe business, competence, personality, or even changing life priori-\nties like a new spouse or children.\nWhen this happens, one or more founders often leave the\nbusiness—sometimes on good terms and sometimes on not such\ngood terms. Some investors know that it’s best to anticipate these\nkinds of issues up front and will try to structure terms that pre-\ndefine how things will work in these situations. The investors are\noften trying to protect the founders from each other by making\nsure things can be cleanly resolved without disrupting the com-\npany more than the departure of a founder already does.\nWe cover this dynamic in terms like vesting, drag-along rights,\nand co-sale rights. When we do, we discuss both the investor perspec-\ntive and the entrepreneur perspective. You’ll see this throughout\nthe book—we’ve walked in both the investor’s and the entrepre-\nneur’s shoes, and we try hard to take a balanced approach to our\ncommentary.\nThe Venture Capitalist\nThe venture capitalist (VC) is the next character in the term sheet\nplay. VCs come in many shapes, sizes, and experience levels. While\nmost (but not all) profess to be entrepreneur friendly, many fall far\nshort of their aspirations. The first sign of this often appears during\nthe term sheet negotiation.\nVenture capital firms have their own hierarchies that are impor-\ntant for an entrepreneur to understand. Later in the book we’ll dive\ninto all the deep, dark secrets about how VCs are motivated and"}

For now, we’ll consider VCs\nas humans and talk about the people.\nThe most senior person in the firm is usually called a managing\ndirector (MD) or a general partner (GP). In some cases, these titles have\nan additional prefix—such as executive managing director or founding\ngeneral partner —to signify even more seniority over the other manag-\ning directors or general partners. These VCs make the final invest-\nment decisions and sit on the boards of directors of the companies\nthey invest in.\nPartners are usually not what their title says they are. Many VCs\nthese days carry business cards with a “Partner” title but are not actu-\nally partners in the firm. Instead, they are often junior deal profes-\nsionals (also referred to as principals or directors—see the next para-\ngraph) or are involved in specific aspects of the investing process\nsuch as deal sourcing. In some firms, which are described as full-stack\nVC firms, these partners help companies across a variety of dimen-\nsions, including recruiting, operations, technology, sales, and mar-\nketing, but are not decision makers in the investment process.\nPrincipals, or directors, are usually next in line. These are junior\ndeal professionals working their way up the ladder to managing\ndirector. Principals usually have some deal responsibility, but they\nalmost always require support from a managing director to move a\ndeal through the VC firm. So while a principal has some power, he\nprobably can’t make a final decision.\nAssociates are typically not deal partners. Instead, they work\ndirectly for one or more deal partners, usually a managing director.\nAssociates do a wide variety of things, including scouting for new\ndeals, helping with due diligence on existing deals, and writing up\nendless internal memos about prospective investments. They are\nalso likely to be the person in the firm who spends the most time\nwith the capitalization table (also known as a cap table), which is\nthe spreadsheet that defines the economics of the deal. Many firms\nhave an associate program, often lasting two years, after which time\nthe associate leaves the firm to go work for a portfolio company, go\nto business school, or start up a company. Occasionally, the star asso-\nciates go on to become principals.\nAnalysts are at the bottom of the ladder. These are very junior\npeople, usually recently graduated from college, who sit in a room\nwith no windows down the hall from everyone else, crunch numbers,\nand write memos. In some firms, analysts and associates play similar"}
{"page": 28, "text": "8 Venture Deals\nroles and have similar functions; in others, the associates are more\ndeal-centric. Regardless, analysts are generally smart people who are\nusually very limited in power and responsibility.\nSome firms, especially larger ones, have a variety of venture part-\nners or operating partners. These are experienced entrepreneurs who\nhave a part-time relationship with the VC firms. While they have\nthe ability to sponsor a deal, they often need explicit support of\none of the MDs, just as a principal would, in order to get a deal\ndone. In some firms, operating partners don’t sponsor deals, but\ntake an active role in managing the investment as a chairman or\nboard member.\nEntrepreneurs in residence (EIRs) are another type of part-time\nmember of the VC firm. EIRs are experienced entrepreneurs who\npark themselves at a VC firm while they are working on figuring out\ntheir next company. They often help the VC with introductions, due\ndiligence, and networking during the 3- to 12-month period that\nthey are an EIR. Some VCs pay their EIRs; others simply provide\nthem with free office space and an implicit agreement to invest in\ntheir next company.\nIn small firms, you might be dealing only with MDs. For exam-\nple, in our firm, Foundry Group, we have a total of five partners, all\ncalled managing directors, each of whom has the same responsibil-\nity, authority, and power. In large firms, you’ll be dealing with a wide\narray of MDs, principals, associates, analysts, venture partners, oper-\nating partners, EIRs, and other titles. Since we wrote the first edition\nof this book in 2011, there has been a huge amount of title inflation\namong VC firms as what was referred to as an associate in 2011 might\nnow be referred to as a partner.\nEntrepreneurs should do their research on the firms they are\ntalking to in order to understand who they are talking to, what\ndecision-making power that person has, and what processes they\nhave to go through to get an investment approved. The best\nsources for this kind of information are other entrepreneurs who\nhave worked with the VC firm in the past, although you’d also be\nsurprised how much of this you can piece together just by look-\ning at how a VC firm presents itself on its website. If all else fails,\nyou can always ask the VC how things work, although the further\ndown the hierarchy of the firm they are, the less likely you’ll get\ncompletely accurate information."}
{"page": 29, "text": "The Players 9\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nManaging directors or general partners have the mojo inside venture capital\nfi rms. If you have anyone else prospecting you or working on the deal with you\n(associate, senior associate, principal, venture partner, or EIR), treat her with an\nenormous amount of respect, but insist on developing a direct relationship with\nan MD or a GP as well. Anyone other than an MD or a GP is unlikely to be at the\nfi rm for the long haul. The MDs and GPs are the ones who matter and who will\nmake decisions about your company.\nFinancing Round Nomenclature\nAside from the humans who work at a venture fi rm, there are also\ndifferent types of venture fi rms. Understanding the different types of\nfi rms will help you target the right ones as you are raising a fi nancing.\nMost fi rms defi ne themselves by the stage of fi nancing they invest\nin. You’ve probably heard of different letters associated with fi nanc-\ning rounds: Series A, Series B, Series B Prime, Series G, Series Seed,\nand even Series Pre-Seed. You’ll hear about Series B-2 rounds and\nSeries D-3 rounds. As funding cycles change, you’ll hear about “The\nSeries A Crunch” or “The Series B Crunch,” or even the notion that\n“The Series A is the new Series B.”\nThere is no magic or legal defi nition in naming rounds. We’d\nprefer to name them after different hiking trails in Boulder, but we’d\nconfuse too many people, so we stick to letters. It used to be that\nthe Series A round was the fi rst fi nancing, the Series B was the next\nround, and the Series C was the next round. After the Series C often\ncame the Series D. You get the picture.\nAt some point, investors who were making very early-stage invest-\nments, also referred to as seed rounds, decided that there needed be\na letter before “A” and started to call those deals Series Seed . While we\nhave always felt it was perfectly reasonable to call these seed rounds\na Series A, this emerged around the time that there was a new wave\nof VC fi rms making seed investments, while at the same time many of\nthe fi rms who previously considered themselves early-stage investors\nwere letting these new fi rms make the fi rst investment. The other\nfi rms still liked to refer to themselves as early-stage investors, so the\nold Series A became the Series Seed and the old Series B started to\nbe called Series A. Today, you’ll occasionally hear of a Pre-Seed Round,"}
{"page": 30, "text": "10 Venture Deals\nwhich is simply an effort to label an earlier round that occurs before\nthe seed round.\nAt the same time, companies didn’t want to have letters that\nextended far into the alphabet. When you are doing your Series K\nround, the first thing a VC wonders is “what is wrong with you?”\nSince an increasing number of rounds were inheriting the same\nterms, either at the same or different price as the earlier round, one\nstarted getting numerical round extensions. When the same inves-\ntors who invested $10 million in a Series B added on another $5\nmillion to the company on the same terms, this became the Series\nB-1. If another $5 million was invested in the company at the same\nterms, this became the Series B-2. When a new investor led the next\n$22 million financing, this finally became the Series C, instead of the\nSeries E, which is what it would have been if the B-1 were the C and\nthe B-2 were the D.\nWhile the labeling of rounds can be complicated, what is impor-\ntant is that there is a language to discuss how early or late stage a\ncompany is when determining what VC might be right for you. Gen-\nerally, Pre-Seed, Seed, and Series A are early-stage companies, Series\nB and C are mid-stage companies, and Series D or later is a late-stage\ncompany.\nTypes of Venture Capital Firms\nNow that we’ve got the nomenclature of rounds down, we can talk\nabout which types of firms invest in which rounds.\nA micro VC fund is a small venture firm that often has only one\ngeneral partner. Many of these folks started out as angel investors,\nwhich we will talk about in the next section, and, after some success,\ncreated a fund to invest other people’s money alongside their own.\nSizes of these funds can vary, but are usually less than $15 million in\ntotal capital per fund. These firms almost exclusively invest at the\nseed and early stages, often alongside other micro VC firms, angel\ninvestors, and friend and family investors.\nSeed-stage funds are generally bigger than micro VCs and can\nscale up to $150 million per fund. They focus on being the first\ninstitutional money into a company and rarely invest in later rounds\npast a Series A. Seed-stage funds often provide your first noncom-\npany board member, so be thoughtful as this relationship goes well\nbeyond just the investment."}
{"page": 31, "text": "The Players 11\nNext up are the early-stage funds. These are the funds that are\ngenerally $100 million to $300 million in size and invest in seed\nstage and Series A companies but occasionally lead a Series B round.\nThese firms also often continue to invest later in the life of a com-\npany, often taking their pro rata in subsequent rounds, which we’ll\nexplain later in this book.\nMid-stage funds are those that generally invest in Series B and\nlater rounds. The funds are often called growth investors, as their first\ninvestment in a company is at a point where a company is clearly\nworking, but now needs capital to accelerate, or continue, its growth.\nThese funds usually range from $200 million to $1 billion in size.\nLate-stage funds enter the picture when the company is now a suc-\ncessful stand-alone business, typically doing its last financing before\na prospective initial public offering (IPO). These include specific\nlate-stage VC funds, but also can be hedge funds, crossover inves-\ntors that invest primarily in the public markets, funds associated with\nlarge banks, or sovereign wealth funds.\nLike all things in the VC world, you can’t categorize each firm\ntightly. Some firms with billion-dollar funds have early-stage programs\nthat invest in young companies. Some firms have multiple funds that\ninvest in different stages of a company, like we do at Foundry Group.\nWe have early-stage funds that invest in the early stages (seed, A, and\nB) and later-stage funds (which we call Foundry Group Select and\nFoundry Group Next) that invest in growth rounds, similar to what\na mid-stage firm would do. Some firms have dedicated programs or\npartners per stage and others invest along the company life cycle\nwith no special delineations.\nUltimately, the key is to make sure that you are targeting the\ntypes of firms that invest in your stage of company. One of the most\ncommon mistakes entrepreneurs make is focusing on firms that are\nirrelevant for them at the stage they are at.\nThe Angel Investor\nIn addition to VCs, your investor group may include individual inves-\ntors, usually referred to as angel investors (or angels for short). These\nangels are often a key source of early-stage investment and are very\nactive in the first round of investment, or the seed stage. Angels can\nbe professional investors, successful entrepreneurs, friends, or fam-\nily members."}
{"page": 32, "text": "12 Venture Deals\nMany VCs are very comfortable investing alongside angels and\noften encourage their active involvement early in the life of a com-\npany. As a result, the angels are an important part of any financ-\ning dance. However, not all angels are created equal, nor do all VCs\nshare the same view of angels.\nWhile angels will invest at various points in time, they usually\ninvest in the early rounds and often don’t participate in future\nrounds. In cases where everything is going well, this is rarely an issue.\nHowever, if the company hits some speed bumps and has a difficult\nfinancing, the angels’ participation in future rounds may come into\nquestion. Some of the terms we discuss in the book, such as pay-to-\nplay and drag-along rights, are specifically designed to help the VCs\nforce a certain type of behavior on the angels (and other VC inves-\ntors) in these difficult financing rounds.\nWhile angel investors are usually high-net-worth individuals, they\naren’t always. There are specific Securities and Exchange Commis-\nsion (SEC) rules around accredited investors, and you should make\nsure that each of your angel investors qualifies as an accredited inves-\ntor or has an appropriate exemption. This has become more compli-\ncated with the passage of the JOBS Act in 2012, and we’ll discuss this\nfurther in Chapter 9, “Crowdfunding.” The best way to ensure you\nare following the rules correctly is to ask your lawyer for help.\nSome angel investors make a lot of small investments. These very\nactive, or promiscuous, angels are called super angels. These super\nangels are often experienced entrepreneurs who have had one or\nmore exits and have decided to invest their own money in new start-\nups. In most cases, super angels are well known in entrepreneurial\ncircles and are often a huge help to early-stage companies.\nAs super angels make more investments, they often decide to\nraise capital from their friends, other entrepreneurs, or institutions.\nAt this point the super angel raises a fund similar to a VC fund and\nbecomes a micro VC. While these micro VCs often want to be thought\nof as angels instead of VCs, once they’ve raised money from other\npeople, they have the same fiduciary responsibility to their investors\nthat a VC has, and as a result they are really just VCs.\nIt’s important to remember that there isn’t a generic angel inves-\ntor archetype (nor is there a generic VC archetype). Lumping them\ntogether and referring to them as a single group can be dangerous.\nNever assume any of these people are like one another. They will all\nhave their own incentives, pressures, experiences, and sophistication"}

Their individual characteristics will often defi ne your working\nrelationship with them well beyond any terms that you negotiate.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nDon’t put yourself in a position where you can be held hostage by angels. They\nare important, but they are rarely in a position to determine the company’s direc-\ntion. If your angel group is a small, diffuse list of friends and family, consider\nsetting up a special-purpose limited partnership controlled by one of them as a\nvehicle for them to invest. Chasing down 75 signatures when you want to do a\nfi nancing or sell the company is not fun.\nAlso, true friends and family need special care. Make sure they under-\nstand up front that (1) they should think of their investment as a lottery ticket,\nand (2) every holiday or birthday party is not an investor relations meeting.\nThe Syndicate\nWhile some VCs invest alone, many invest with other VCs. A collec-\ntion of investors is called a s yndicate .\nWhen VCs refer to the syndicate, they are often talking about\nthe major participants in the fi nancing round, which are usually but\nnot always VCs. The syndicate includes any investor, whether a VC,\nangel, super angel, strategic investor, corporation, law fi rm, or any-\none else that ends up purchasing equity in a fi nancing.\nMost syndicates have a lead investor . Usually, but not always, this is\none of the VC investors. Two VCs will often co-lead a syndicate, and\noccasionally you’ll see three co-leads.\nWhile there is nothing magical about who the lead investor is,\nhaving one often makes it easier for the entrepreneurs to focus their\nenergy around the negotiation. Rather than having one-off negotia-\ntions with each investor, the lead in the syndicate will often take the\nrole of negotiating terms for the entire syndicate.\nRegardless of the lead investor or the structure of the syndicate,\nit is the entrepreneurs’ responsibility to make sure they are com-\nmunicating with each of the investors in the syndicate. As the entre-\npreneur, even though the lead investor may help corral the other\ninvestors through the process, don’t assume that you don’t need to\ncommunicate with each of the investors—you do!\nBe careful of too many cooks in the kitchen. In the past few years,\nthe idea of a party round, where many investors make relatively small"}
{"page": 34, "text": "14 Venture Deals\ninvestments at the early stage, has become popular. It isn’t unusual\nto see a $2 million seed round with 10 VCs and 20 angel investors in\nthe round. While it might seem nice to have all these fancy names in\na press release, the entrepreneurs get very little attention from any\nof the investors since their investments were all tiny relative to what\nthe VCs normally invest. As companies raise their next round, they\nrealize they have the worst of all possible worlds—lots of VCs who are\ninvestors, but none who are committed in a meaningful way.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nWhile you should communicate with all investors, you should insist that inves-\ntors agree (at least verbally) that the lead investor can speak for the whole\nsyndicate when it comes to investment terms. You should not let yourself be in\na position where you have to negotiate the same deal multiple times. If there is\ndissension in the ranks, ask the lead investor for help.\nThe Lawyer\nAh, the lawyers—I bet you thought we’d never get to them. In deals,\na great lawyer can be a huge help and a bad lawyer can be a disaster.\nFor the entrepreneur, an experienced lawyer who understands\nVC fi nancings is invaluable. VCs make investments all the time.\nEntrepreneurs raise money occasionally. Even a very experienced\nentrepreneur runs the risk of getting hung up on a nuance that a VC\nhas thought through many times.\nIn addition to helping negotiate, a great lawyer can focus the\nentrepreneur on what really matters. While this book will cover all\nthe terms that typically come up in a VC fi nancing, we’ll continue to\nrepeat a simple mantra that the real terms that matter are economics\nand control. Yes, annoying VCs will inevitably spend time negotiat-\ning for an additional S-3 registration right (an unimportant term\nthat we’ll discuss later), even though the chance it ever comes into\nplay is very slight. This is just life in a negotiation—there are always\nendless tussles over unimportant points, sometimes due to silly rea-\nsons, but they are often used as a negotiating strategy to distract you\nfrom the main show. VCs are experts at this; a great lawyer can keep\nyou from falling into these traps."}
{"page": 35, "text": "The Players 15\nHowever, a bad lawyer, or one inexperienced in VC fi nancings,\ncan do you a world of harm. In addition to getting outnegotiated,\nthe inexperienced lawyer will focus on the wrong issues, fi ght hard\non things that don’t matter, and run up the bill on both sides. We’ve\nencountered this numerous times. Whenever an entrepreneur wants\nto use a cousin who is a divorce lawyer, we take an aggressive posi-\ntion before we start negotiating that the entrepreneur needs a lawyer\nwho has a clue.\nNever forget that your lawyer is a refl ection on you. Your repu-\ntation in the startup ecosystem is important, and a bad or inexpe-\nrienced lawyer will tarnish it. Furthermore, once the deal is done,\nyou’ll be partners with your investors, so you don’t want a bad or inex-\nperienced lawyer creating unnecessary tension in the fi nancing nego-\ntiation that will carry over once you are partners with your investors.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nAt the same time that you don’t want an inexperienced lawyer creating unnec-\nessary tension in the negotiation, don’t let a VC talk you out of using your lawyer\nof choice just because that lawyer isn’t from a nationally known fi rm or the\nlawyer rubs the VC the wrong way. This is your lawyer, not your VC’s lawyer.\nThat said, to do this well, you need to be close enough to the communication\nto make sure your lawyer is being reasonable and communicating clearly and\nin a friendly manner.\nWhile lawyers usually bill by the hour, many lawyers experienced\nwith VC investments will cap their fees in advance of the deal. As of\nthis writing in 2016, an early-stage fi nancing can be done for between\n$5,000 and $20,000 and a typical mid- to late-stage fi nancing can be\ncompleted for between $20,000 and $40,000. Lawyers in large cities\ntend to charge more, and if your company has any items to clean up\nfrom your past, your costs will increase.\nIf your lawyers and the VC lawyers don’t get along, your bill can\nskyrocket if you don’t stay involved in the process. If the lawyers are\nunwilling to agree to a modest fee cap, you should question whether\nthey know what they are doing.\nIn case you are curious, these numbers are virtually unchanged\nfrom a decade ago while billable rates have more than doubled in\nthe same time.

Once again, the entre-\npreneur must take responsibility for the fi nal results.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nDon’t be shy about insisting that your lawyer cap their fee at a modest number\nor even that the lawyer will only get paid out of the proceeds of a deal. There’s\nno reason, if you are a solid entrepreneur with a good business, that even a top-\ntier law fi rm won’t take your unpaid deal to its executive committee as a fl ier to\nbe paid on closing.\nThe Mentor\nEvery entrepreneur should have a stable of experienced m entors .\nThese mentors can be hugely useful in any fi nancing, especially if\nthey know the VCs involved.\nWe like to refer to these folks as mentors instead of advisers\nsince the word adviser often implies that there is some sort of fee\nagreement with the company. It’s unusual for a company, espe-\ncially an early-stage one, to have a fee arrangement with an adviser\naround a fi nancing. Nonetheless, there are advisers who prey on\nentrepreneurs by showing up, offering to help raise money, and\nthen asking for compensation by taking a cut of the deal. There\nare even some bold advisers who ask for a retainer relationship to\nhelp out. We encourage early-stage entrepreneurs to stay away from\nthese advisers.\nIn contrast, mentors help the entrepreneurs, especially early-\nstage ones, primarily because someone once helped them. Many\nmentors end up being early angel investors in companies or get a\nsmall equity grant for serving on the board of directors or board of\nadvisers, but they rarely ask for anything up front.\nWhile having mentors is never required, we strongly encourage\nentrepreneurs to fi nd them, work with them, and build long-term\nrelationships with them.

His seminal statement to young Luke Skywalker is one we\nbelieve every entrepreneur should internalize before hitting the fund-\nraising trail. You must have the mind-set that you will succeed on\nyour quest.\nWhen we meet people who say they are “trying to raise money,”\n“testing the waters,” or “exploring different options,” this not only\nis a turnoff but also often shows they’ve not had much success. Start\nwith an attitude of presuming success. If you don’t, investors will\nsmell this uncertainty on you; it’ll permeate your words and actions.\nNot all entrepreneurs will succeed when they go out to raise\na financing. Failure is a key part of entrepreneurship, but, as with\n19"}
{"page": 39, "text": "20 Venture Deals\nmany things in life, attitude impacts outcome and this is one of\nthose cases.\nNote that this advice does not pertain to informal meetings with\ninvestors about what you are doing. We meet with plenty of entrepre-\nneurs who aren’t raising money just to get to know them. However,\nas soon as the switch flips to an active fundraising process, you must\nbe all in.\nDetermine How Much You Are Raising\nBefore you hit the road, figure out how much money you are going\nto raise. This will impact your choice of those you speak to in the\nprocess. For instance, if you are raising a $500,000 seed round, you’ll\ntalk to angel investors, seed-stage VCs, super angels, micro VCs, and\nearly-stage investors, including ones from very large VC funds. How-\never, if you are going out to raise $10 million, you should start with\nlarger VC firms since you’ll need a lead investor who can write at\nleast a $5 million check.\nWhile you can create complex financial models that determine\nthat you need a specific amount of capital down to the penny to\nbecome cash flow positive, we know one thing with complete cer-\ntainty: these models will be wrong. Instead, focus on a length of\ntime you want to fund your company to get to the next meaningful\nmilestone. If you are just starting out, how long will it take you to\nship your first product? If you have a product in the market, how\nlong will it take to get to a certain number of users or a specific\nrevenue amount? Then, assuming no revenue growth; what is your\nmonthly spend, also known as burn rate, that you need to get to this\npoint? If you are starting out and think it’ll take six months to get a\nproduct to market with a team of eight people, you can quickly esti-\nmate that you’ll spend around $100,000 per month for six months.\nGive yourself some time cushion (say, a year) and raise $1 million,\nsince it’ll take you a few months to ramp up to a $100,000-per-month\nburn rate.\nThe length of time you need varies dramatically by business. In a\nseed stage software company, you should be able to make real prog-\nress in around a year. If you are trying to get a drug approved by\nthe Food and Drug Administration (FDA), you’ll need at least sev-\neral years. Don’t obsess about getting this exactly right—as with your\nfinancial model, it’s likely wrong (or approximate at best). Just make"}

That said, be careful not to overspecify the milestones that\nyou are going to achieve—you don’t want them showing up in your\nfinancing documents as specific milestones that you have to attain.\nBe careful not to go out asking for an amount that is larger than\nyou need, since one of the worst positions you can be in during a\nfinancing is to have investors interested, but be too far short of your\ngoal. For example, assume you are a seed-stage company that needs\n$500,000 but you go out looking for $1 million. One of the questions\nthat the VCs and angels you meet with will probably ask you is: “How\nmuch money do you have committed to the round?” If you answer\nwith “I have $250,000 committed,” a typical angel may feel you’re\nnever going to get there and will hold back on engaging just based\non the status of your financing. However, being able to say “I’m at\n$400,000 on a $500,000 raise and we’ve got room for one or two\nmore investors” is a powerful statement to a prospective angel inves-\ntor since most investors love to be part of an oversubscribed round.\nFinally, we don’t believe in ranges in the fundraising process.\nWhen someone says they are raising $5 million to $7 million, our\nfirst question is: “Is it $5 million or $7 million?” Though it might\nfeel comfortable to offer up a range in case you can’t get to the high\nend of it, presumably you want to raise at least the low number. The\nrange makes it appear like you are hedging your bets or that you\nhaven’t thought hard about how much money you actually need to\nraise. Instead, we always recommend stating that you are raising a\nspecific number. If you end up with more investor demand than you\ncan handle, you can always raise a larger amount of money.\nAlso keep in mind that the difference between $5 million and $7\nmillion might not sound like much to you, but it could make all the\ndifference in the world to the VC you are speaking to. If the largest\nfirst check a VC writes is $3 million, then a $5 million round means\nthey can be the lead investor. However, in a $7 million round, they\ncan only be a co-lead or a follower. While you should never change\nthe amount of money you are raising to entice a VC, keep in mind\nthat having a range makes your targeting and conversations murkier.\nFundraising Materials\nWhile the exact fundraising materials you will need can vary widely\nby VC, there are a few basic things that you should create before you"}
{"page": 41, "text": "22 Venture Deals\nhit the fundraising trail. At the minimum, you need a short descrip-\ntion of your business, an executive summary, and a presentation that is\noften not so fondly referred to as “a PowerPoint” despite the fact that\nmany of us are using Google Docs these days. Some investors will\nask for a business plan or a private placement memorandum; this is\nmore common in later-stage investments.\nOnce upon a time, physical form seemed to matter. In the\n1980s, elaborate business plans were professionally printed at the\ncorner copy shop and mailed out. Today, virtually all materials\nare sent via email. Quality still matters a lot, but it’s usually in sub-\nstance with appropriate form. Don’t overdesign your information—\nwe can’t tell you the number of times we’ve received a highly styl-\nized executive summary that was organized in such a way as to be\nvisually appealing, yet completely lacking in substance. Focus on\nthe content while making the presentation solid and able to stand\non its own.\nWhatever you send us must be clear, concise, interesting, and\neasy for us to process alone early in the morning in the darkness of\nour office at home. If you need to talk us through it, you have lost\nthe battle before you’ve started. Do not make the common mistake\nof thinking that you’ll send us a teaser and then get to talk through\nthe details at a meeting. Realize that whatever you send a VC is often\nboth your first and last impression, so make it count.\nFinally, while never required, many investors (such as us) respond\nto things we can play with, so even if you are a very early-stage com-\npany, a prototype or demo is desirable.\nShort Description of Your Business\nYou’ll need a few paragraphs that you can email, often called the\nelevator pitch, meaning you should be able to give it during the length\nof time it takes for an elevator to go from the first floor to your pro-\nspective investor’s office. Don’t confuse this with the executive sum-\nmary, which we discuss next; rather, this is one to three paragraphs\nthat describe the product, the team, and the business very directly. It\ndoesn’t need to be a separate document that you attach to an email;\nthis is the bulk of the email, often wrapped with an introductory\nparagraph, especially if you know the person or are being referred\nto the person, and a concluding paragraph with a very clear request\nfor whatever next step you want."}
{"page": 42, "text": "How to Raise Money 23\nExecutive Summary\nThe executive summary is a one- to three-page description of your\nidea, product, team, and business. It’s a short, concise, well-written\ndocument that is the first substantive document and interaction\nyou’ll likely have with a prospective investor with whom you don’t\nhave a preexisting relationship. Think of the executive summary as\nthe basis for your first impression and expect it to be passed around\nwithin a VC firm if there’s any interest in what you are doing.\nWork hard on the executive summary—the more substance you\ncan pack into this short document, the more a VC will believe that\nyou have thought critically about your business. It also is a direct\nindication of your communication skills. A poorly written summary\nthat leaves out key pieces of information will cause the VC to assume\nthat you haven’t thought deeply about some important issues or that\nyou are trying to hide bad facts about the business. Our inner gram-\nmar nerds suggest you have someone not involved in your company\nproofread your materials.\nIn the executive summary, include the problem you are solving\nand why it’s important to solve. Explain why your product is awe-\nsome, why it’s better than what currently exists, and why your team is\nthe right one to pursue it. End with some high-level financial data to\nshow that you have aggressive but sensible expectations about how\nyour business will perform over time.\nYour first communication with a VC is often an introductory\nemail, either from you or from someone referring you to the VC,\nthat is a combination of the short description of your business along\nwith the executive summary attached to the email. If your first inter-\naction was a face-to-face meeting either at a conference, at a coffee\nshop, or in an elevator, if a VC is interested he’ll often say something\nlike “Can you send me an executive summary?” Do this the same day\nthat it is requested of you to start to build momentum to the next\nstep in the process.\nPresentation\nOnce you’ve engaged with a VC firm, you’ll quickly be asked either to\ngive or to email a presentation. This is usually a 10- to 20-page Power-\nPoint presentation consisting of a substantive overview of your busi-\nness. There are many different presentation styles and approaches,\nand what you need will depend on the audience (one person, a VC"}
{"page": 43, "text": "24 Venture Deals\npartnership, or 500 people at an investor day type of event). Your\ngoal with the presentation is to communicate the same information\nas the executive summary, but using a visual presentation.\nOver time, a number of different presentation styles have\nemerged. A three-minute presentation at a local pitch event is just as\ndifferent from an eight-minute presentation at an a ccelerator ’s inves-\ntor day as it is from a 30-minute presentation to a VC partnership.\nRecognize your audience and tune your presentation to them. Real-\nize also that the deck you email as an overview can be different from\nthe one you present, even if you are covering similar material.\nWork hard on the presentation fl ow and format. In this case,\nform matters a great deal—it’s amazing how much more positive\na response is to well-designed and well-organized slides, especially\nif you have a consumer-facing product where user experience will\nmatter a lot for its success. If you don’t have a good designer on\nyour team, fi nd a freelance designer to help you turn your presen-\ntation into something visually appealing. This is especially true\nif you are creating a consumer-facing product. If you can’t cre-\nate good-looking slides, how are you going to create a killer user\nexperience? Put some extra effort into this—it will pay off many\ntimes over.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\n“Less is more” when it comes to an investor presentation. There are only a few\nkey things most VCs look at to understand and get excited about a deal: the\nproblem you are solving, the size of the opportunity, the strength of the team, the\nlevel of competition or competitive advantage that you have, your plan of attack,\nand current status. Summary fi nancials, use of proceeds, and milestones are\nalso important. Most good investor presentations can be done in 10 slides\nor fewer.\nBusiness Plan\nWe haven’t read a business plan in over 20 years. Sure, we still get\nplenty of them, but it is not something we care about as we invest in\nareas we know well, and as a result we much prefer demos and live\ninteractions. Fortunately, most business plans arrive in email these\ndays, so they are easy enough to ignore since one doesn’t have to\nphysically touch them. However, realize that some VCs care a lot"}
{"page": 44, "text": "How to Raise Money 25\nabout seeing a business plan, regardless of the current view by many\npeople that a business plan is an obsolete document.\nThe business plan is usually a 30-page-plus document that has\nall sorts of sections and is something you would learn to write if you\nwent to business school. It goes into great detail about all facets of\nthe business, expanding on the executive summary to have compre-\nhensive sections about the market, product, target customer, go-to-\nmarket strategy, team, and financials.\nWhile we think business plans prepared specifically for fundrais-\ning are a waste of time, we still believe that they are valuable docu-\nments for entrepreneurs to write while they are formulating their\nbusinesses. There are lots of different approaches today, including\nmany that are user- or customer-centric, but the discipline of writing\ndown what you are thinking, your hypotheses about your business,\nand what you believe will happen is still very useful.\nNow, we aren’t talking about a conventional business plan,\nalthough this can be a useful approach. If you are a software com-\npany, consider some variant of the Lean Startup methodology that\nincludes the creation, launch, and testing of a minimum viable prod-\nuct as a starting point. Instead of writing an extensive document, use\nPowerPoint to organize your thoughts into clear sections, although\nrecognize that this is very different from the presentation you are\ngoing to give potential investors.\nYou will occasionally be asked for a business plan. Be prepared\nfor this and know how you plan to respond, along with what you will\nprovide, if and when this comes up.\nPrivate Placement Memorandum\nA private placement memorandum (PPM) is essentially a traditional busi-\nness plan wrapped in legal disclaimers that are often as long as the\nplan itself. It’s time consuming and expensive to prepare, and you\nget the privilege of paying lawyers thousands of dollars to proofread\nthe document and provide a bunch of legal boilerplate to ensure\nyou don’t say anything that you could get sued for later.\nNormally, PPMs are generated only when investment bankers are\ninvolved and are fundraising from large entities, banks, or late-stage\ninvestors that demand a PPM. In the past few years, bankers have\noften shifted to PowerPoint-type presentations with endless bullet\npoints, instead of prose, because they are easier to create and likely\neasier to consume."}
{"page": 45, "text": "26 Venture Deals\nWe’ve seen plenty of early-stage companies hire bankers and\ndraft PPMs. To us, this is a waste of money and time. When we see an\nemail from a banker sending us a PPM for an early-stage company,\nwe automatically know that investment opportunity isn’t for us and\nalmost always toss it in the circular file.\nOur view is that if an early-stage company has hired a banker to\nhelp with fundraising, either it has been unsuccessful in its attempt\nto raise money and is hoping the banker can help it in a last-ditch\neffort or it is getting bad advice from its advisers (who may be the\nones making a fee from marketing the deal via the PPM). While\nmany later-stage investors like to look at all the stuff they get from\ninvestment bankers, we think this is a pretty weak approach for an\nearly-stage company.\nDetailed Financial Model\nThe only thing that we know about financial predictions of startups\nis that 100 percent of them are wrong. If you can predict the future\naccurately, we have a few suggestions for other things you could be\ndoing besides starting a risky early-stage company. Furthermore, the\nearlier stage the startup, the less accurate any predications will be.\nWhile we know you can’t predict your revenue with any degree of\naccuracy (although we are always very pleased in that rare case where\nrevenue starts earlier and grows faster than expected), the expense\nside of your financial plan is very instructive as to how you think\nabout the business.\nYou can’t predict your revenue with any level of precision, but you\nshould be able to manage your expenses exactly to plan. Your finan-\ncials will mean different things to different investors. In our case,\nwe focus on two things: (1) the assumptions underlying the revenue\nforecast (which we don’t need a spreadsheet for—we’d rather just\ntalk about them) and (2) the monthly burn rate or cash consump-\ntion of the business. Since your revenue forecast will be wrong, your\ncash flow forecast will be wrong. However, if you are an effective man-\nager, you’ll know how to budget for this by focusing on lagging your\nincrease in cash spend behind your expected growth in revenue.\nOther VCs are much more spreadsheet driven. Some firms (usu-\nally those with associates) may go so far as to perform discounted\ncash flow analyses to determine the value of your business. Some\nwill look at every line item and study it in detail. Others only focus"}
{"page": 46, "text": "How to Raise Money 27\non certain things that matter to them. For instance, what is your\nhead count over the next few quarters, and how fast do you expect\nto acquire users or customers? Although none of us know your busi-\nness better than you do, VCs will apply their experience and frames\nof reference to your financial model as they evaluate how well you\nunderstand the financial dynamics of your business.\nIn later financing rounds, your company’s historical financial\nperformance, underlying unit economics, cost structure, and future\nfinancial plan will matter a lot more to your prospective VCs. At\nthis point, you’ve been in business for a while. You are now raising\nmoney against your track record and the extrapolation of that into\nthe future, rather than just an idea, a dream, and a fantasy.\nThe Demo\nMost VCs love demos. In the short time before we wrote this sec-\ntion, we got to play with an industrial robot, wear a device that\ntracked anxiety level, interact with software that measured the\nnumber of times we smiled while we watched a video, saw a projec-\ntion system that worked on curved walls with incredible fidelity,\ngave real blood out of our arms for a new health analysis technol-\nogy, and played around with a Web service that figured out the\nnews we were interested in based on a new approach to leveraging\nour social graphs. We learned more from the demos, especially\nabout our emotional interest in the pro ducts we played with, than\nany document could communicate. Each of these demos also gave\nus a chance to talk directly to the entrepreneurs about how they\nthought about their current and future pro ducts, and we got a\nclear view of the enthusiasm and obsession of the entrepreneurs\nfor what they are working on.\nWe believe the demo, a prototype, or an alpha is far more impor-\ntant than a business plan or financial model for a very early-stage\ncompany. The demo shows us your vision in a way we can interact\nwith. More important, it shows us that you can build something and\nthen show it off. We expect demos to be underfeatured, to be rough\naround the edges, and to crash. We know that you’ll probably throw\naway the demo on the way to a final product and what we are invest-\ning in will evolve a lot. But like many 14-year-olds, we just want to play.\nDemos are just as important in existing companies. If you have\na complex product, figure out a way to show it off in a short period"}
{"page": 47, "text": "28 Venture Deals\nof time. We don’t need to see every feature; use your demo to tell us\na story about the problem your product addresses. And give us the\nsteering wheel—we want to play with the demo, not just be passive\nobservers. While we are playing, watch us carefully because you’ll\nlearn an enormous amount about us in that brief period of time\nwhile you see how comfortable we are, whether our eyes light up,\nand whether we really understand what you are pursuing.\nDue Diligence Materials\nAs you go further down the financing path, VCs will ask for addi-\ntional information. If a VC offers you a term sheet, expect their law-\nyers to ask you for a bunch of things such as capitalization tables,\ncontracts, material agreements, employment agreements, and board\nmeeting minutes. The list of documents requested during the for-\nmal due diligence process (usually after signing of the term sheet,\nbut not always) can be long. For an example, see the “Resources”\npage at www.venturedeals.com. The number of documents you will\nactually have depends on how long you have been in business. Even\nif you are a young company just starting up, we recommend that\nbefore you go out to raise money, you organize all of these docu-\nments for quick delivery to a potential funding partner so you don’t\nslow down the process when they ask for them.\nYou should never try to hide anything with any of these fundrais-\ning materials. Although you are trying to present your company in\nthe best light possible, you want to make sure any issues you have are\nclearly disclosed. Deal with any messy stuff up front. If a VC forgets\nto ask for something early on, assume you will be asked for it before\nthe deal is done. If you happen to get something past a VC and get\nfunded, it will eventually come out that you weren’t completely trans-\nparent and your relationship will suffer. A good VC will respect full\ndisclosure early on and, if they are interested in working with you,\nwill actively engage to help you get through any challenges you have,\nor at least give you feedback on why there are showstoppers that you\nhave to clear up before you raise money.\nFinding the Right VC\nThe best way to find the perfect VC is to ask your friends and other\nentrepreneurs. They can give you unfiltered data about which VCs"}
{"page": 48, "text": "How to Raise Money 29\nthey’ve enjoyed working with and who have helped build their busi-\nnesses. It’s also the most efficient approach, since an introduction\nto a VC from an entrepreneur who knows both you and the VC is\nalways more effective than you sending a cold email to vcname@\nvcfirm.com.\nBut what should you do if you don’t have a large network for\nthis? Back in the early days of venture capital, it was very hard to\nlocate even the contact information for a VC, and you rarely found\nthem in the yellow pages, not even next to the folks who give payday\nloans. Today, VCs have websites and blogs, tweet endlessly, and even\nlist their email addresses on their websites.\nEntrepreneurs can discover a lot of information about their\npotential future VC partners, well beyond the mundane contact\ninformation. You’ll be able to discover what types of companies\nthey invest in, what stage of growth they prefer to invest in, past suc-\ncesses, failures, approaches, and strategies (at least their marketing\napproaches), and bios on the key personnel at the firm.\nIf the VC has a social media presence, you’ll be able to take all\nof that information and infer things like their hobbies, theories on\ninvesting, beer they drink, instruments they play, and type of build-\ning or facility—such as a bathroom—they like to endow at their local\nuniversities. If you follow them on Foursquare, you can even figure\nout what kind of food they like to eat.\nWhile it may seem obvious, engaging a VC that you don’t know\nvia social media can be useful as a starting point to develop a rela-\ntionship. In addition to the ego gratification of having a lot of Twit-\nter followers (hint: now is the time to follow @jasonmendelson and\n@bfeld if you aren’t already), you’ll start to develop an impression\nand, more importantly, a relationship if you comment thoughtfully\non blog posts the VC writes. It doesn’t have to be all business—\nengage at a personal level, offer suggestions, interact, and follow the\nbest rule of developing relationships: “give more than you get.” And\nnever forget the simple notion that if you want money, ask for advice.\nDo your homework. When we get business plans from medical\ntech companies or somebody insisting we sign a nondisclosure agree-\nment (NDA) before we review a business plan, we know that they did\nabsolutely zero research on our firm or us before they sent us the\ninformation. At best, the submission doesn’t rise to the top com-\npared to more thoughtful correspondences, and at worst it doesn’t\neven elicit a response from us."}
{"page": 49, "text": "30 Venture Deals\nA typical VC gets thousands of inquiries a year. The vast majority\nof these requests are from people whom the VC has never met and\nwith whom the VC has no relationship. Improve your chances of\nhaving VCs respond to you by researching them, getting a referral\nto them, and engaging with them in whatever way they seem to be\ninterested in.\nFinally, don’t forget this works both ways. You may have a super-\nhot deal and as a result have your pick of VCs to fund your company.\nDo your homework and find out who will be most helpful to your\nsuccess, has a temperament and style that will be compatible with\nyours, and will ultimately be your best long-term partner. Remember\nthat the average length of a relationship between a VC and founder\nis on par with the average length of a marriage in the United States.\nFinding a Lead VC\nAssuming that you are talking with multiple potential investors, you\ncan generally categorize them into one of three groups: leaders, fol-\nlowers, and everyone else. It’s important to know how to interact\nwith each of these groups. If not, you not only will waste a lot of your\ntime but also might be unsuccessful in your fundraising mission.\nYour goal is to find a lead VC. This is the firm that is going to give\nyou a term sheet, take a leadership role in driving to a financing, and\nlikely be your most active new investor. It’s possible to have co-leads\n(usually two, occasionally three) in a financing. It’s also desirable to\nhave more than one VC competing to lead your deal without them\nknowing who else you are talking to.\nAs you meet with potential VCs, you’ll get one of four typical\nvibes. First is the VC who is clearly interested and wants to lead. Next\nis the VC who isn’t interested and passes. These are the easy ones—\nengage aggressively with the ones who want to lead and don’t worry\nabout the ones who pass.\nThe other two categories—the “maybe” and the “slow no”—are\nthe hardest to deal with. The “maybe” seems interested, but doesn’t\nreally step up his level of engagement. This VC seems to be hanging\naround, waiting to see if there’s any interest in your deal. Keep this per-\nson warm by continually meeting and communicating with him, but\nrealize that this VC is not going to catalyze your investment. However,\nas your deal comes together with a lead, this VC is a great one to bring\ninto the mix if you want to put a syndicate of several firms together."}
{"page": 50, "text": "How to Raise Money 31\nThe “slow no” is the hardest to figure out. These VCs never actu-\nally say no, but are completely in react mode. They’ll occasionally\nrespond when you reach out to them, but there is no perceived for-\nward motion on their part. You always feel like you are pushing on\na rope—there’s a little resistance but nothing ever really moves any-\nwhere. We recommend you think of these VCs as a “no” and don’t\ncontinue to spend time with them.\nKeep your head up and stay optimistic throughout the process.\nWe realize how frustrating finding a lead VC can be. We also get\nfrustrated with VCs, who aren’t transparent and deal in maybes and\nact as slow nos. If it makes you feel any better, we face the same thing\nwhen we go out to raise money from our investors. Most of all, learn\nfrom all the feedback you get and don’t take any of it personally.\nHow VCs Decide to Invest\nLet’s explore how VCs decide to invest in a company and what the\nprocess normally looks like. All VCs are different, so these are gen-\neralizations but more or less reflect the way that VCs make their\ndecisions.\nThe way that you get connected to a particular VC affects the\nprocess that you go through. Some VCs will fund only entrepreneurs\nwith whom they have a prior connection. Other VCs prefer to be\nintroduced to entrepreneurs by other VCs. Some VCs invest only in\nseasoned entrepreneurs and avoid working with first-time entrepre-\nneurs, whereas others, like us, will fund entrepreneurs of all ages\nand experience levels and will try to be responsive to anyone who\ncontacts us. Whatever the case is, you should determine quickly if\nyou reached a particular VC through her preferred channel or you\nare swimming upstream from the beginning.\nNext, you should understand the role of the person within the\nVC firm who is your primary connection. If an associate reached out\nto you via email, consider that his job is to scour the universe looking\nfor deals but that the associate probably doesn’t have any real pull to\nget a deal done. It doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t meet with her,\nbut also don’t get overly excited until there is a general partner or\nmanaging director at the firm paying attention to and spending real\ntime with you.\nYour first few interactions with a VC firm will vary widely depend-\ning on the firm’s style and who your initial contact is. However, at"}
{"page": 51, "text": "32 Venture Deals\nsome point it will be apparent that the VC has more than a passing\ninterest in exploring an investment in you and will begin a process\noften known as due diligence . This isn’t a formal legal or technical\ndiligence; rather, it’s code for “I’m taking my exploration to the\nnext level.”\nYou can learn a lot about the attitude and culture of a VC fi rm by\nthe way it conducts its diligence. For example, if you are raising your\nfi rst round of fi nancing and you have no revenue and no product,\na VC who asks for a fi ve-year detailed fi nancial projection and then\nproceeds to hammer you on the numbers is probably not someone\nwho has a lot of experience or comfort making early-stage invest-\nments. As mentioned before, we believe the only thing that can be\nknown about a pre-revenue company’s fi nancial projections is that\nthey are wrong.\nDuring this phase, a VC will ask for a lot of things, such as pre-\nsentations, projections, customer pipeline or targets, development\nplan, competitive analysis, and team bios. This is all normal. In some\ncases, the VCs will be mellow and accept what you’ve already created\nin anticipation of the fi nancing. In other cases, they’ll make you run\naround like a headless chicken and create a lot of busywork for you.\nIn either case, before you jump through hoops providing this infor-\nmation, make sure a partner-level person (usually a managing direc-\ntor or general partner) is involved and that you aren’t just the object\nof a fi shing expedition by an associate.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nIf you feel like your VC is a proctologist, run for the hills.\nWhile the VC fi rm goes through its diligence process on you, we\nsuggest you return the favor and ask for things like introductions to\nother founders they’ve backed. Nothing is as illuminating as a dis-\ncussion with other entrepreneurs who’ve worked with your potential\ninvestor.

{"page": 52, "text": "How to Raise Money 33\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nThe best VCs will give you, either proactively or reactively, a list of all the entre-\npreneurs they’ve worked with in the past and ask you to pick a few for reference\nchecks. The best reference checks are ones you can do where the company\nwent through hard times, maybe swapped out a founder for another CEO, or\neven failed, as you will learn from these how the VC handled messy and adver-\nsarial situations.\nYou’ll go through multiple meetings, emails, phone calls, and\nmore meetings. You may meet other members of the fi rm or you may\nnot. You may end up going to the VC’s offi ces to present to the entire\npartnership on a Monday, a tradition known by many fi rms as the\nMonday partner meeting. In other cases, as with our fi rm, if things\nare heating up you’ll meet with each of the partners relatively early\nin the process in one-on-one or group settings.\nAs things unfold, either you’ll continue to work with the VC in\nexploring the opportunity or the VC will start slowing down the pace\nof communication. Be very wary of the VC who is hot on your com-\npany, then warm, then cold, but never really says no. While some\nVCs are quick to say no when they lose interest, many VCs don’t\nsay no because either they don’t see a reason to, they want to keep\ntheir options open, they are unwilling to affi rmatively pass on a deal\nbecause they don’t want to have to shut the door, or they are just\nplain impolite and disrespectful to the entrepreneur.\nUltimately, VCs will decide to invest or not invest. If they do, the\nnext step in the process is for them to issue a term sheet.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nIf a VC passes on a deal with you, whether graciously or by not returning your\nemails and your calls, do your best to politely insist on feedback as to why. This\nis one of the most important lessons an entrepreneur can learn and is especially\nuseful during the fundraising cycle. Don’t worry that someone is telling you that\nyour baby is ugly. Ask for the feedback, demand it, get it, absorb it, and learn\nfrom it."}
{"page": 53, "text": "34 Venture Deals\nUsing Multiple VCs to Create Competition\nChoice is power. Having multiple VCs interested in your company\nwill provide insight into how different firms work and give you the\nnegotiation leverage to improve the terms of the deal.\nIf you want to create a competitive process, allow at least six\nmonths to raise money. If you start the process earlier than this, you\nwon’t feel urgency to get a deal done, nor will your prospective inves-\ntors. If you start with less time, you may not have enough time to get\nthe financing done before you run out of money. A short window to\nget a financing done can lead to many VCs passing since they won’t\nhave enough time to evaluate your company. In other cases, VCs will\nsense desperation when you only have a few months left before run-\nning out of money, which doesn’t help your negotiating position.\nAfter you’ve started to engage with a particular VC, make sure\nyou understand their process. A few will tell you, but most won’t.\nAfter you’ve had a second meeting, ask what the process going for-\nward is. While you might get a vague answer, you’ll often get some\nclues as to what the next steps and decision points are.\nTiming is everything. While it is hard enough to get multiple par-\nties interested, you also need to make sure that the timing of each of\ntheir processes line up. It doesn’t do you any good if you get three\nVCs interested in you 18 months apart. If you have a sense of process,\nyou can bias your energy toward the firms with a longer process in an\neffort to synchronize the delivery of term sheets.\nBe careful to understand what a slow process actually means.\nWhile annoying, many VCs have a slow process because they are bad\nat saying no and prefer to string along entrepreneurs to give the VC\nfirm option value in the situation where a deal starts to heat up. If a\nVC is having trouble giving you clear and timely feedback, or is reluc-\ntant to be clear in their description, you may be speaking to some-\none who doesn’t have the power in their firm to get a deal done.\nThat is why we always suggest that you interact, as much as possible,\nwith managing directors and general partners.\nSome VCs will ask you who else you are talking to. If your goal is\nto create a competitive process, never answer this question. If you do,\nthe next email a VC will send is one to someone at the firms you told\nthem you were talking to, asking what they think of you and your deal.\nSometimes this works in your favor, but only in cases where the firms\ncompete fiercely with each other for deals or in situations where firms"}

Either way, it’s better to stay quiet about other\nconversations early on and only make connections between firms that\nare known collaborators as term sheets start to fly.\nDo your homework. Be as strategic in your fundraising as\nyou are with your business. Plan ahead. Talk to everyone you can\nabout which VCs to speak to, and don’t waste your time with those\nwho don’t invest in your stage or sector. Be up front and direct\nand get as much information as you can during the fundraising\nprocess.\nClosing the Deal\nThe most important part of the fundraising process is to close the\ndeal, raise the money, and get back to running your business. How\ndo you actually close the deal?\nSeparate it into two activities: the first is the signing of the term\nsheet and the second is signing the definitive documents and getting\nthe cash. This book is primarily about getting a term sheet signed.\nIn our experience, most executed term sheets result in a financing\nthat closes. Reputable VCs, especially early-stage firms, can’t afford\nto have term sheets signed and then not follow through; otherwise,\nthey don’t remain reputable for long.\nThis can be different for later-stage firms. Often, you’ll agree to\na term sheet, albeit a nonbinding one, but you aren’t done with the\ndeal process yet. Many later-stage firms have a final formal approval\nstep, known as their investment committee, before they actually\nclose a deal. In the past few years, we have seen several cases where\na signed term sheet from the fund wasn’t actually approved by the\ninvestment committee. In these cases, the company and VC pro-\nceeded as though the term sheet would lead to a deal and, after lots\nof diligence and legal drafting, the investment committee turned\ndown the deal and the VC walked away, often putting the company\nin a difficult situation.\nThe most likely situations that derail financings are when VCs\nfind unexpected bad facts about the company after term sheet sign-\ning. You should assume that a signed term sheet will lead to money\nin the bank as long as there are no smoking guns in your company’s\npast, the investor is a professional one, and you don’t do anything\nstupid in the definitive document drafting process."}
{"page": 55, "text": "36 Venture Deals\nThe second part of closing the deal is the process of drafting\nthe definitive agreements. Generally, the lawyers do most of the\nheavy lifting here. They will take the term sheet and start to negoti-\nate the 100-plus pages of documentation that are generated from\nthe term sheet. In the best-case scenario, you respond to due dili-\ngence requests, and one day you are told to sign some documents.\nThe next thing you know, you have money in the bank and a new\nboard member with whom you are excited to work.\nIn the worst case, however, the deal blows up. Or perhaps the deal\ncloses, but there are hard feelings left on both sides. Throughout\nthe process, manage it on a daily basis. Don’t let the lawyers behave\npoorly, as this will only injure the future relationship between you\nand your investor. Make sure that you are responsive with requests,\nand never assume that because your lawyer is angry and says the\nother side is horrible/stupid/evil/worthless that the VC even has a\nclue what is going on. Many times, we’ve seen legal teams get com-\npletely tied up on an issue and want to kill each other when nei-\nther the entrepreneur nor the VC even cared or had any notion that\nthere was a dustup over the issue.

All of the participants were to\nblame, and ignorance of what really mattered in the negotiation\nkept things going much longer than was necessary. We talked about\nwhat to do and, at the risk of giving away super-top-secret venture\ncapital magic tricks, decided to write a blog series on Brad’s blog\n( Feld Thoughts — www.feld.com ) that deconstructed a venture capital\nterm sheet and explained each section.\nThat blog series was the inspiration for this book. The next few\nchapters cover the most frequently discussed terms in a venture capi-\ntal term sheet. Many venture capitalists (VCs) love to negotiate hard\non every term as though the health of their children depended on\nthem getting the terms just right. Sometimes this is inexperience on\nthe part of the VC; often, it’s just a negotiating tactic.\nThe specifi c language that we refer to is from actual term sheets.\nIn addition to describing and explaining the specifi c terms, we give\nyou examples of what to focus on and implications from the perspec-\ntives of the company, VCs, and entrepreneurs.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nThe term sheet is critical.

{"page": 57, "text": "38 Venture Deals\nThe Key Concepts: Economics and Control\nIn general, there are only two things that VCs really care about when\nmaking investments: economics and control. Economics refers to the\nreturn the investors will ultimately get in a liquidity event, usually\neither a sale of the company, a wind down, or an initial public offer-\ning (IPO), and the terms that have direct impact on this return.\nControl refers to the mechanisms that allow the investors either to\naffi rmatively exercise control over the business or to veto certain\ndecisions the company can make. If you are negotiating a deal and\ninvestors are digging their heels in on a provision that doesn’t impact\nthe economics or control, they are often blowing smoke, rather than\nelucidating substance.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nEconomics and control are important things to pay attention to, in and of them-\nselves. They rule the day. An inexperienced VC will harp on other terms need-\nlessly. You can give in on them or not, but the mere fact that a VC focuses on\nunimportant terms is a sign of what that VC will be like to work with as an owner,\nboard member, and compensation committee member.\nWhen companies are created, the founders receive common stock .\nHowever, when VCs invest in companies, they purchase equity and\nin the vast majority of cases receive preferred stock . In the following\nchapters we’ll be referring to terms that the preferred shareholders\nare receiving.\nAs we described earlier, separate fi nancings are usually referred\nto as a series designated by a letter, such as S eries A . The fi rst round is\noften called the Series A fi nancing, although recently a new round\noccurring before the Series A has appeared, called the Series Seed\nfi nancing. The letter is incremented in each subsequent fi nancing,\nso Series B fi nancings follow Series A, and Series C fi nancings follow\nSeries B. You’ll occasionally see a number added onto the letter for\nsubsequent rounds, such as Series A-1 or Series B-2. This is generally\ndone to try to limit how far into the alphabet you go and is often\nused when the same investors do subsequent rounds in a company\ntogether. While we aren’t aware of the world record for number of\nfi nancings in a private company, we have seen a Series K fi nancing.\nIn the following chapters, we walk you through language for\neach term and detailed examples. Let’s get started by exploring the\neconomic terms."}
{"page": 58, "text": "Venture Deals: Be Smarter than Your Lawyer\nand Venture Capitalist, Third Edition\nBy Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson\nCopyright © 2016 by Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson\n4\nC H A P T E R\nEconomic Terms of the Term Sheet\nW\nhen discussing the economics of a venture capital deal, one\noften hears the question, “What is the valuation?” While the valua-\ntion of a company, determined by multiplying the number of shares\noutstanding by the price per share, is one component of the deal,\nit’s a mistake to focus only on the valuation when considering the\neconomics of a deal.\nIn this chapter we discuss all of the terms that make up the eco-\nnomics of the deal, including price, liquidation preference, pay-to-\nplay, vesting, the employee pool, and antidilution.\nPrice\nThe first economic term, and the one most entrepreneurs focus on\nmore than any other, is the price of the deal. Following is the typical\nway price is represented in a term sheet.\nPrice: $ per share (the Original Purchase Price). The Origi-\nnal Purchase Price represents a fully diluted pre-money valua-\ntion of $ million and a fully diluted post-money valuation\nof $ million. For purposes of the above calculation and any\nother reference to fully diluted in this term sheet, fully diluted\nassumes the conversion of all outstanding preferred stock of the\nCompany, the exercise of all authorized and currently existing\nstock options and warrants of the Company, and the increase of\nthe Company’s existing option pool by [X] shares prior to this\nfinancing.\n39"}
{"page": 59, "text": "40 Venture Deals\nA somewhat different way that price can be represented is by\ndefining the amount of the financing, which backs into the price.\nFor example:\nAmount of Financing: An aggregate of $X million, representing\na % ownership position on a fully diluted basis, including\nshares reserved for any employee option pool. Prior to the Clos-\ning, the Company will reserve shares of its Common Stock so\nthat % of its fully diluted capital stock following the issuance\nof its Series A Preferred is available for future issuances to direc-\ntors, officers, employees, and consultants.\nWhile price per share is the ultimate measure of what is being paid\nfor the equity being bought, price is often referred to as valuation.\nThere are two different ways to discuss valuation: pre-money and\npost-money. The pre-money valuation is what the investor is valuing\nthe company at today, before investment, while the post-money valu-\nation is simply the pre-money valuation plus the contemplated aggre-\ngate investment amount. With this, you’ve encountered the first trap\nthat venture capitalists (VCs) often lead entrepreneurs into.\nWhen a VC says, “I’ll invest $5 million at a valuation of $20 mil-\nlion,” the VC usually means the post-money valuation. In this situ-\nation, the VC’s expectation is that a $5 million investment will buy\n25% of a $20 million post-money company. At the same time, an\nentrepreneur might hear a $5 million investment at a pre-money valu-\nation of $20 million, which would buy only 20% of the $25 million\npost-money company. The words are the same but the expectations\nare very different.\nThe term sheet language usually spells this out in detail. However,\nwhen you are starting the negotiation with the VC, you’ll often have\na verbal discussion about price. How you approach this sets the tone\nfor a lot of the balance of the negotiation. By addressing the ambi-\nguity up front, you demonstrate that you have knowledge about the\nbasic terms. The best entrepreneurs we’ve dealt with are presumptive\nand say something like “I assume you mean $20 million pre-money.”\nThis forces the VC to clarify, and if in fact she did mean $20 million\npre-money, it doesn’t cost you anything in the negotiation.\nThe next part of price to focus on is the phrase fully diluted. Both\nthe company and the investor will want to make sure the company\nhas sufficient equity (or stock options) reserved to compensate and"}
{"page": 60, "text": "Economic Terms of the Term Sheet 41\nmotivate its workforce. This is also known as the employee pool or option\npool . The bigger the pool the better, right? Not so fast. Although a\nlarge option pool will make it easier to give good option packages\nto new hires while it being less likely that the company will run out\nof available options, the size of the pool is taken into account in the\nvaluation of the company. This lowers the actual pre-money valua-\ntion and is common valuation trap number two.\nLet’s stay with our previous example of a $5 million investment at\n$20 million pre-money. Assume that you have an existing option pool\nthat has options representing 10% of the outstanding stock reserved\nand unissued. The VCs suggest that they want to see a 20% option\npool. In this case, the extra 10% will come out of the pre-money valu-\nation, resulting in an effective pre-money valuation of $18 million.\nThere is no magic number for the option pool, and this is often\na key point of the pricing negotiation. The typical early-stage com-\npany option pool ends up in a range of 10% to 20%, with later-stage\ncompanies having smaller option pools. If the investors believe that\nthe option pool of the company should be increased, they will insist\nthat the increase happens prior to the fi nancing.\nYou have several negotiating approaches. You can fi ght the pool\nsize, trying to get the VCs to end up at 15% instead of 20%. Or you\ncan negotiate on the pre-money valuation; accept a 20% pool but\nask for a $22 million pre-money valuation. Or you can suggest that\nthe increase in the option pool gets added to the deal post-money,\nwhich will result in the same pre-money valuation but a higher post-\nmoney one.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nVCs will want to minimize their risk of future dilution as much as possible by\nmaking the option pool as large as possible up front. When you have this nego-\ntiation, you should come armed with an o ption budget . List out all of the hires\nyou plan on making between today and your next anticipated fi nancing date and\nthe approximate option grant you think it will take to land each one of them. You\nshould be prepared to have an option pool with more options than your budget\ncalls for, but not necessarily by a huge margin. The option budget will be critical\nin this conversation with your potential investor.\nAnother economic term that you will encounter, especially in\nlater-stage fi nancings, is warrants associated with fi nancings. As with"}
{"page": 61, "text": "42 Venture Deals\nthe stock option pool allocation, this is another way for an investor\nto sneak in a lower valuation for the company. A warrant is similar to\na stock option; it is a right for an investor to purchase a certain num-\nber of shares at a predefined price for a certain number of years. For\nexample, a 10-year warrant for 100,000 shares of Series A stock at $1\nper share gives the warrant holder the option to buy 100,000 shares\nof Series A stock at $1 per share anytime in the next decade, regard-\nless of what the stock is worth at the moment in time the investor\navails himself of (or exercises) the warrant.\nWarrants as part of a venture financing, especially in an early-\nstage investment (where they are rare), tend to create a lot of\nunnecessary complexity and accounting headaches down the road.\nIf the issue is simply one of price, we recommend the entrepreneur\nnegotiate for a lower pre-money valuation to try to eliminate the\nwarrants. Occasionally, this may be at cross purposes with existing\ninvestors who, for some reason, want to artificially inflate the valua-\ntion, since the warrant value is rarely calculated as part of the valu-\nation even though it impacts the future allocation of proceeds in a\nliquidity event.\nThere is one type of financing—the bridge loan—in which war-\nrants are commonplace. A bridge loan occurs when an investor is\nplanning to do a financing, but is waiting for additional investors\nto participate. In the bridge loan scenario, the existing investor will\nmake the investment as convertible debt, which will convert into equity\nat the price of the upcoming financing. Since the bridge loan inves-\ntor took additional risk, he generally gets either a discount on the\nprice of the equity (usually up to 20%) or warrants that effectively\ngrant a discount (again usually up to 20%, although occasionally\nmore). In bridge round cases, it’s not worth fighting these warrants\nas long as they are structured reasonably.\nThe best way to negotiate a higher price is to have multiple VCs\ninterested in investing in your company. This is Economics 101; if\nyou have more demand (VCs interested) than supply (equity in your\ncompany to sell), then price will increase. In early rounds, your new\ninvestors will likely be looking for the lowest possible price that still\nleaves enough equity in the founders’ and employees’ hands. In\nlater rounds, your existing investors will often argue for the highest\nprice for new investors in order to limit the dilution of the exist-\ning investors. If there are no new investors interested in investing\nin your company, your existing investors will often argue for a price"}
{"page": 62, "text": "Economic Terms of the Term Sheet 43\nequal to ( fl at round ) or lower than (d own round ) the price of the\nprevious round. Finally, new investors will always argue for the lowest\nprice they think will enable them to get a fi nancing done, given the\nappetite (or lack thereof) of the existing investors for putting more\nmoney into the company. As an entrepreneur, you are faced with\nall of these contradictory motivations in a fi nancing, reinforcing\nthe truism that it is incredibly important to pick your early investors\nwisely, since they can materially help or hurt this process.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nThe best Plan A has a great Plan B standing behind it. The more potential inves-\ntors you have interested in investing in your company, the better your negotiat-\ning position is. Spend as much time on your best alternative to a negotiated\nagreement (BATNA) as possible.\nBy now you may be wondering how VCs really value companies.\nIt is not an exact science regardless of the number of spreadsheets\ninvolved. VCs typically take into account many factors when deciding\nhow to value a potential investment—some are quantifi able whereas\nothers are completely qualitative. Following are some of the differ-\nent factors, along with brief explanations of what impacts them.\nStage of the company. Early-stage companies tend to have a valu-\n●\nation range that is determined more by the experience of the\nentrepreneurs, the amount of money being raised, and the\nperception of the overall opportunity. As companies mature,\nthe historical fi nancial performance and future fi nancial pro-\njections start to impact valuation. In later-stage companies,\nsupply and demand for the fi nancing combined with fi nan-\ncial performance dominate, as investors are beginning to look\ntoward an imminent exit event.\nCompetition with other funding sources . The simple time-tested\n●\nrule for the entrepreneur is “more is better.” When VCs feel\nthat they are competing with other VCs for a deal, price tends\nto increase. However, a word of caution—don’t overplay com-\npetition that doesn’t exist. If you do and get caught, you’ll\ndamage your current negotiating position, potentially lose the\nexisting investor that you have at the table, and, if nothing"}

Our belief is that you should always negotiate honestly.\nOver representing your situation rarely ends well.\nExperience of the entrepreneurs and leadership team.

There will be some pricing\n●\ninfluence depending on how large, or trendy, the market is\nthat you are playing in.\nThe VC’s natural entry point. Some VCs are early-stage investors\n●\nand will invest only at low price points. For example, we know\nof one well-known early-stage investor who publicly states the\nintention not to invest at a valuation above $10 million post-\nmoney. Later-stage investors tend to be much less focused on\na specific price level and care more about the specific status\nof the company. While VC firms often have stated strategies,\nit’s often the case that they will diverge from these strategies,\nespecially when markets heat up.\nNumbers, numbers, numbers. The numbers matter. Whether it is\n●\npast performance; predictions of the future; revenue; earnings\nbefore interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA);\ncash burn; or head count, they each factor into the determina-\ntion of price. That being said, don’t believe everything your\nMBA professor told you about DCF (discounted cash flow, for\nthose of you without an MBA), especially for early-stage compa-\nnies. Remember, the only thing you know for sure about your\nfinancial projections at the early stages is that they are wrong.\nCurrent economic climate. Though this is out of the control of\n●\nthe entrepreneur, it weighs heavily on pricing. When the\nmacro economy or stock market is in the dumps, valuations\nare lower. When the macro economy is growing quickly, valu-\nations go up. Specifically, valuations often expand when there\nis future optimism forecasted about the macro economy.\nHowever, these events are not tightly correlated, especially in\nthe technology sector.\nRegardless of an investor’s justification for the valuation they are\ngiving you, recognize that it’s a guess stimulated by multiple factors.\nWhile numbers matter more in the later stages, don’t be insulted if\nyour valuation and a VC’s valuation aren’t the same, as each of you"}
{"page": 64, "text": "Economic Terms of the Term Sheet 45\nis coming from a different perspective. Our best advice to entrepre-\nneurs on maximizing price is to focus on what you can control and\nget several different VCs interested in your fi nancing.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nI encourage entrepreneurs not to take valuation personally. Just because VCs\nsay their take is that your business is worth $6 million, when your take is that\nyour business is worth $10 million, doesn’t mean that they lack appreciation for\nyou as a CEO or your business’s future potential. It means they are negotiating\na deal to their advantage, just as you would.\nLiquidation Preference\nThe liquidation preference is the next most important economic\nterm after price and impacts how the proceeds are shared in a liquid-\nity event, which is usually defi ned as a sale of the company or the\nmajority of the company’s assets. The liquidation preference is espe-\ncially important in cases in which a company is sold for less than the\namount of capital invested.\nThere are two components that make up what most people call\nthe liquidation preference: the actual preference and participation.\nTo be accurate, the term liquidation preference should pertain only to\nmoney returned to a particular series of the company’s stock ahead of\nother series of stock. Consider, for instance, the following language:\nLiquidation Preference: In the event of any liquidation or wind-\ning up of the Company, the holders of the Series A Preferred\nshall be entitled to receive in preference to the holders of the\nCommon Stock a per share amount equal to [X] times the Orig-\ninal Purchase Price plus any declared but unpaid dividends (the\nLiquidation Preference).\nThis is the actual preference. In this language, a certain multiple\nof the original investment per share is returned to the investor before\nthe common stock receives any consideration. For many years, a 1×\nliquidation preference, or simply the amount of money invested,\nwas the standard. In 2001, as the Internet bubble burst, investors\noften increased this multiple, sometimes as high as 10× (10 times"}
{"page": 65, "text": "46 Venture Deals\nthe amount of money invested). Over time, rational thought pre-\nvailed and this number has generally returned to 1×, although you\nwill often see multiple preferences, also known as structure, appear in\nlater-stage or distressed financings.\nThe next thing to consider is whether the investors’ shares are par-\nticipating. While many people consider the term liquidation preference\nto refer to both the preference and the participation, it’s important to\nseparate the concepts. There are three varieties of participation: full\nparticipation, capped participation, and no participation.\nFully participating stock will receive its liquidation preference\n(typically 1×, but it can be more) and then share in the liquidation\nproceeds on an as-converted basis, where “as-converted” means as if\nthe stock were converted into common stock based on its conversion\nratio. The provision normally looks like this:\nParticipation: After the payment of the Liquidation Preference\nto the holders of the Series A Preferred, the remaining assets\nshall be distributed ratably to the holders of the Common Stock\nand the Series A Preferred on a common equivalent basis.\nCapped participation indicates that the stock will receive its liq-\nuidation preference and then share in the liquidation proceeds on\nan as-converted basis until a certain multiple return is reached. If the\nreturn is greater than the cap, then the participation will not apply.\nSample language is as follows:\nParticipation: After the payment of the Liquidation Preference\nto the holders of the Series A Preferred, the remaining assets\nshall be distributed ratably to the holders of the Common Stock\nand the Series A Preferred on a common equivalent basis, pro-\nvided that the holders of Series A Preferred will stop partici-\npating once they have received a total liquidation amount per\nshare equal to [X] times the Original Purchase Price, plus any\ndeclared but unpaid dividends. Thereafter, the remaining assets\nshall be distributed ratably to the holders of the Common Stock.\nOne interesting thing to note in this section is the actual mean-\ning of the multiple of the original purchase price (the [X]). If the\nparticipation multiple is three (three times the original purchase\nprice), it would mean that the preferred would stop participating"}
{"page": 66, "text": "Economic Terms of the Term Sheet 47\n(on a per share basis) once 300% of its original purchase price was\nreturned, including any amounts paid out on the liquidation prefer-\nence. This is not an additional 3× return, but rather an additional\n2×, assuming the liquidation preference was a 1× money-back return.\nPerhaps this correlation with the actual preference is the reason the\nterm liquidation preference has come to include both the preference\nand participation terms. If the series is not participating, it will not\nhave a paragraph that looks like the preceding ones.\nNo participation indicates that the stock doesn’t participate after\nreceiving their liquidation preference. In this case, also known as a\n“simple preferred” or “nonparticipating preferred,” the investor has\na choice—they can either get their money back or they can convert\ninto common stock and get proceeds equal to their percentage of\nownership of the company on an as-converted basis.\nWe’ll talk at length about conversion in Chapter 5, but keep in\nmind that the holders of preferred can always convert their pre-\nferred stock into common stock if it benefits them. This happens\nwhen a nonparticipating or capped participating preferred holder\nwould make more money by converting to common than if they took\ntheir liquidation preference and participation (if any).\nSince we’ve been talking about liquidation preferences, it’s impor-\ntant to define what a liquidation event is. Often, entrepreneurs think of\na liquidation event as a bad thing, such as a bankruptcy or a winding\ndown of the company. In VC-speak, a liquidation is actually tied to\na liquidity event in which the shareholders receive proceeds for their\nequity in a company and includes mergers, acquisitions, or a change\nof control of the company. As a result, the liquidation preference sec-\ntion determines the allocation of proceeds in both good times and\nbad. Standard language defining a liquidation event looks like this:\nLiquidation Event: A merger, acquisition, sale of voting control\nin which the shareholders of the Company do not own a major-\nity of the outstanding shares of the surviving corporation or sale\nof all or substantially all of the assets of the Company shall be\ndeemed to be a liquidation. Any acquisition agreement that pro-\nvides for escrowed or other contingent consideration will pro-\nvide that the allocation of such contingent amounts properly\naccounts for the liquidation preference of the Preferred Stock.\nIronically, lawyers don’t necessarily agree on a standard defi-\nnition of a liquidation event. Jason once had an entertaining and"}
{"page": 67, "text": "48 Venture Deals\nunpleasant debate during a guest lecture he gave at his alma mater\nlaw school (University of Michigan, for those of you wondering) with\na partner from a major Chicago law firm. At the time, this partner\nwas teaching a venture class that semester and claimed that an initial\npublic offering (IPO) should be considered a liquidation event. His\ntheory was that an IPO was the same as a merger, that the company\nwas going away, and thus the investors should get their proceeds.\nEven if such a theory were accepted by an investment banker who\nwould be willing to take the company public (there’s not a chance,\nin our opinion), it makes no sense, as an IPO is simply another fund-\ning event for the company, not a liquidation of the company. In fact,\nin almost all IPO scenarios, the VC’s preferred stock is converted to\ncommon stock as part of the IPO, eliminating the issue around a\nliquidity event in the first place.\nLet’s see how this plays out in real life with some examples. To\nkeep it simple, let’s assume that there has been only one round of\nfinancing (a Series A investment) of $5 million at a $10 million pre-\nmoney valuation. The post-money is $15 million in this case. The\nSeries A investors own 33.3% of the company ($5 million/$15 mil-\nlion), and the entrepreneurs own 66.7% of the company. We are\ngoing to look at four scenarios:\nCase 1: The Series A stock has a 1× liquidation preference and\nno participation;\nCase 2: The Series A stock has a 2× liquidation preference and\nno participation;\nCase 3: The Series A stock has a 1× liquidation preference and is\nfully participating (no cap); and\nCase 4: The Series A stock has a 1× liquidation preference and is\nparticipating up to a 3× cap.\nFor the ease of math, we’ll also round the ownership numbers to\n33% and 67%, respectively, instead of dealing with repeating deci-\nmals. In the real world, spreadsheets come in handy here.\nNow, assume that the company has an offer to be acquired for\n$5 million.\nNotice that the preferred holders, so long as they have a 1×\nliquidation preference (regardless of any participation features),"}
{"page": 68, "text": "Economic Terms of the Term Sheet 49\nhave the right to the entire consideration of the deal given that they\ninvested $5 million and the deal size doesn’t clear the investment\namount. With companies that have raised a lot of money, any acquisi-\ntion that doesn’t clear the invested capital leaves the common shut\nout of the proceeds. You’ll hear this mentioned as the liquidation\npreference overhang, which is the amount of money that needs to be\nreturned to investors to satisfy all liquidation preferences before the\ncommon holders begin to receive some of the proceeds.\nNow, assume that the company has an offer to be acquired for\n$15 million.\nCase 1: 1× preference, nonparticipating. The Series A can either take\nits $5 million liquidation preference and be done, or convert\nto common and take 33% of the proceeds, which in this case\nis also $5 million. Note that the common gets $10 million\nhere.\nCase 2: 2× preference, nonparticipating. The Series A can either\ntake their 2× preference, which is $10 million, or convert\nto common and take 33%, which is $5 million. In this case,\nthe Series A takes the $10 million, leaving $5 million to the\ncommon, which is half of what they would have made in\nCase 1.\nCase 3: 1× preference, participating. In this case, the Series A inves-\ntors will get the first $5 million and then 33% of the remain-\ning amount, or $3.3 million (33% of $10 million) for a total\nreturn of $8.3 million. The common will get 67% of the $10\nmillion, or $6.7 million. Notice that in a fully participating\nsecurity, there is never any reason for the preferred to convert.\nThink of this situation as having your cake and eating it also.\nCase 4: 1× preference, participating with a 3× cap. In this case, the\npreferred will not reach the cap ($15 million), so this will be\nthe same as Case 3.\nNow, assume that the company has an offer to be acquired for\n$30 million.\nCase 1: 1× preference, nonparticipating. In this case, the Series A\nconverts and gets 33%, or $10 million, and the common will"}
{"page": 69, "text": "50 Venture Deals\nget 67%, or $20 million. If the Series A did not convert, they\nwould only receive $5 million, which is why it converts.\nCase 2: 2× preference, nonparticipating. In this case, the Series A\ninvestors will get 33%, or $10 million, and the common will\nget 67%, or $20 million. Note that both the conversion and\nnonconversion cases lead to the same allocation of proceeds.\nCase 3: 1× preference, participating. In this case, the Series A inves-\ntors will get the first $5 million and then 33% of the remain-\ning amount, or $8.3 million (33% of $25 million) for a total\nreturn of $13.3 million. The common will get 67% of the $25\nmillion, or $16.7 million.\nCase 4: 1× preference, participating with a 3× cap. In this case, the\npreferred will not reach the cap ($15 million), so this will be\nthe same as Case 3. The preferred will not convert and will\ntake $13.3 million, with the common getting $16.7 million.\nFinally, assume the purchase price is $100 million.\nCase 1: 1× preference, nonparticipating. The Series A investors will\nget 33%, or $33 million, and the common will get 67%, or\n$67 million. The Series A converts, as otherwise it would only\nreceive $5 million.\nCase 2: 2× preference, nonparticipating. The Series A investors will\nget 33%, or $33 million, and the entrepreneurs will get 67%,\nor $67 million. The Series A again converts; otherwise, it\nwould only receive $10 million.\nCase 3: 1× preference, participating. Again, the Series A investors\nget the first $5 million and then 33% of the remaining $95\nmillion, or $31.35 million, for a total of $36.35 million.\nThe common get 67% of the remaining $95 million, or\n$63.65 million.\nCase 4: 1× preference, participating with a 3× cap. In this example,\nthe Series A makes a return better than 3× ($15 million),\nso the participation doesn’t happen and the results are the\nsame as in Cases 1 and 2.\nAs you can see from this example, the participation feature has\na lot of impact at relatively low outcomes and less impact (on a"}
{"page": 70, "text": "Economic Terms of the Term Sheet 51\npercentage of the deal basis) at higher outcomes. The participation\nfeature will also matter a lot more as more money is raised that has\nthe participation feature (e.g., Series B and C). To understand this,\nlet’s do one last example, this time of a company that has raised\n$50 million where the investors own 60% and the entrepreneurs\nown 40%. Assume the company is being acquired for $100 million.\nCase 1: 1× preference, nonparticipating. The investors can either take\n$50 million or convert. They convert, since doing so results\nin them getting $60 million. The common gets $40 million.\nCase 2: 2× preference, nonparticipating. The investors will get $100\nmillion, or all of the consideration, since it is 2× their invested\ncapital. The common gets nothing. Ouch.\nCase 3: 1× preference, participating. Investors get the first $50 mil-\nlion and then 60% of the remaining $50 million ($30 mil-\nlion) for a total of $80 million. The common gets 40% of the\nremaining $50 million, or $20 million. Again, ouch.\nCase 4: 1× preference, participating with a 3× cap. Since the investors\nwon’t make greater than 3× ($150 million) on this deal, this\nis the same as Case 3.\nLiquidation preferences are usually easy to understand and assess\nwhen dealing with a Series A term sheet. It gets much more compli-\ncated to understand what is going on as a company matures and\nsells additional series of equity, since understanding how liquidation\npreferences work between the various series is often mathematically,\nand structurally, challenging. As with many VC-related issues, the\napproach to liquidation preferences among multiple series of stock\nvaries and is often overly complex for no apparent reason.\nThere are two primary approaches:\n1. The follow-on investors will stack their preferences on top of\neach other (known as stacked preferences) where Series B gets\nits preference first, then Series A.\n2. The series are equivalent in status (known as pari passu or\nblended preferences) so that Series A and B share proratably\nuntil the preferences are returned.\nDetermining which approach to use is a black art that is influ-\nenced by the relative negotiating power of the investors involved,"}

This time, our example company has\nraised two rounds of financing, a Series A ($5 million invested at\na $10 million pre-money valuation) and a Series B ($20 million\ninvested at a $30 million pre-money valuation). Now, let’s deal with a\nlow outcome, one where the liquidation preference is going to come\ninto play, namely a sale of the company for $15 million.\nIf the preference is stacked, the Series B investors will get the\nentire $15 million. In fact, in this case it won’t matter what the pre-\nmoney valuation of the Series B was; they’ll get 100% of the consid-\neration regardless.\nHowever, if the preference is blended, the Series A will get 20%\nof every dollar returned (in this case $3 million) and the Series B\nwill get 80% of every dollar returned (or $12 million), based on their\nrelative amounts of the capital invested in the company.\nIn each of these cases the entrepreneurs will receive nothing,\nregardless of whether the preference is participating or nonpartici-\npating, since the preference is $25 million and the company is being\nsold for $15 million, or less than the preference.\nNote that investors get either the liquidation preference and\nparticipation amounts (if any) or what they would get on a fully\nconverted common holding, at their election; they do not get both.\nRealize, however, that in the fully participating case the investors get\ntheir participation amount and then receive what they would get on\na fully converted common holding basis.\nIn early-stage financings, it’s actually in the best interest of both\nthe investor and the entrepreneur to have a simple liquidation pref-\nerence and no participation. In future rounds, the terms are often\ninherited from the early-stage terms. So if you have a participating\npreferred in a seed round, you could expect to have a participating\npreferred in all subsequent rounds. In this case, if the seed inves-\ntor doesn’t participate in future rounds, his economics in many out-\ncomes could actually be worse with the participation feature. While\nthe early investor might think he is negotiating a great deal for him-\nself, early investors end up looking like the common holders (in\nterms of returns) since their preference amounts are so small. As a\nresult, we recommend entrepreneurs and our VC co-investors keep\nit simple and lightweight in early rounds."}

There’s a fi ne balance here and each case is\nsituation specifi c, but a rational investor will want a combination of\nthe best price while ensuring maximum motivation of management\nand employees. Obviously, what happens in the end is a negotia-\ntion and depends on the stage of the company, bargaining strength,\nand existing capital structure; but in general most companies and\ntheir investors will reach a reasonable compromise regarding these\nprovisions. Ultimately, reputable investors will rarely leave the man-\nagement team with nothing on a liquidation event that is below the\nliquidation preferences despite what the legal documents dictate, a\nsituation called a management carve-out, which we will discuss later.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nLiquidation preference is a critical term that is part of most equity fi nancings\nother than small angel fi nancings. Participating preferred deals have become\nan unfortunate standard over the years where VCs have essentially decided on\na new standard fl oor for deals that require the repayment of principal as well as\na common stock interest in the company on the sale of a company.

Entrepreneurs should band together to reinstate this as a\nstandard!\nAnything other than a straight participating preferred security, such as mul-\ntiple preferences, is just greedy on the part of VCs and should be a red fl ag to\nyou about the investor.\nPay-to-Play\nThe pay-to-play provision is another important economic term that is\nusually relevant in a down round fi nancing and can be very useful to\nthe entrepreneur in situations where the company is struggling and\nneeds another fi nancing. A typical pay-to-play provision follows:\nPay-to-Play: In the event of a Qualifi ed Financing (as defi ned\nbelow), shares of Series A Preferred held by any Investor which\nis offered the right to participate but does not participate fully"}
{"page": 73, "text": "54 Venture Deals\nin such financing by purchasing at least its pro rata portion as\ncalculated above under “Right of First Refusal” below will be\nconverted into Common Stock.\nA Qualified Financing is the next round of financing after the\nSeries A financing by the Company that is approved by the\nBoard of Directors who determine in good faith that such por-\ntion must be purchased pro rata among the stockholders of the\nCompany subject to this provision. Such determination will be\nmade regardless of whether the price is higher or lower than any\nseries of Preferred Stock.\nAt the turn of the millennium, a pay-to-play provision was rarely\nseen. After the Internet bubble burst in 2001, it became ubiquitous.\nInterestingly, this is a term that most companies and their investors\ncan agree on if they approach it from the right perspective.\nIn a pay-to-play provision, investors must keep participating pro-\nratably in future financings (paying) in order to not have their pre-\nferred stock converted to common stock (playing) in the company.\nThere are various levels of intensity of the pay-to-play provi-\nsion. The preceding one is pretty aggressive when compared to this\nsofter one:\nIf any holder of Series A Preferred Stock fails to participate\nin the next Qualified Financing (as defined below), on a pro\nrata basis (according to its total equity ownership immediately\nbefore such financing) of their Series A Preferred investment,\nthen such holder will have the Series A Preferred Stock it owns\nconverted into Common Stock of the Company. If such holder\nparticipates in the next Qualified Financing but not to the full\nextent of its pro rata share, then only a percentage of its Series\nA Preferred Stock will be converted into Common Stock (under\nthe same terms as in the preceding sentence), with such per-\ncentage being equal to the percent of its pro rata contribution\nthat it failed to contribute.\nWhen determining the number of shares held by an Investor or\nwhether this “Pay-to-Play” provision has been satisfied, all shares\nheld by or purchased in the Qualified Financing by affiliated\ninvestment funds shall be aggregated.

It causes the investors to stand up at the\ntime of their original investment and agree to support the company\nduring its life cycle. If they do not, the stock they have is converted\nfrom preferred to common and they lose the rights associated with\nthe preferred stock. When our co-investors push back on this term,\nwe ask: “Why? Are you not going to fund the company in the future\nif other investors agree to?” Remember, this is not a lifetime guaran-\ntee of investment; rather, if other prior investors decide to invest in\nfuture rounds in the company, there will be a strong incentive for\nall of the prior investors to invest or subject themselves to total or\npartial conversion of their holdings to common stock. A pay-to-play\nterm ensures that all the investors agree in advance to the rules of\nengagement concerning future financings.\nThe pay-to-play provision impacts the economics of the deal by\nreducing liquidation preferences for the nonparticipating investors.\nIt also impacts the control of the deal since it reshuffles the future\npreferred shareholder base by ensuring that only the committed\ninvestors continue to have preferred stock and the corresponding\nrights that go along with preferred stock.\nWhen companies are doing well, the pay-to-play provision is\noften waived since a new investor wants to take a large part of the\nnew round. This is a good problem for a company to have, as it typi-\ncally means there is an up-round financing, existing investors can\nhelp drive company-friendly terms in the new round, and the inves-\ntor syndicate increases in strength by virtue of new capital (and, pre-\nsumably, another helpful co-investor) in the deal.\nThe pay-to-play provision may not be appropriate, especially in\nearly rounds if you have investors who generally do not participate\nin follow on rounds as a matter of business practice. For instance, if\na micro VC or seed fund leads your round, they often don’t ever par-\nticipate in future funding rounds. In these cases, a pay-to-play provi-\nsion will inappropriately penalize them in the future for supporting\nyou at the beginning when you critically needed their funding. Make\nsure that you understand the future funding dynamics of your VC\npartner and treat them accordingly."}
{"page": 75, "text": "56 Venture Deals\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nThis pay-to-play provision is pretty good for you as an entrepreneur, at least as\nit’s described here. Conversion to common is no big deal in the grand scheme\nof things. What you want to avoid is a pay-to-play scenario where your VC has\nthe right to force a recapitalization of the company (e.g., a fi nancing at a $0\npre-money valuation, or something suitably low) if fellow investors don’t play\ninto a new round.\nA provision like this can be particularly bad for less sophisticated angel\ninvestors (e.g., your friends and family) if they don’t have the understanding or\nresources to back up their initial investment with future follow-on investments,\nand can make for uncomfortable conversations around family events.\nThere are many circumstances where reasonable investors who like the\ncompany can’t or won’t participate in a fi nancing—their venture fund is over,\nor they are strategic or angel investors and don’t have the funds or charter to\ncontinue investing—and you and they shouldn’t be punished excessively for not\nparticipating (remember, a recapitalization hurts you, too, even if you get new\noptions, which always carry vesting, to “top you off”). But conversion to com-\nmon for lack of follow-on investment is appropriate.\nVesting\nAlthough vesting is a simple concept, it can have profound and\nunexpected implications. Typically, stock and options will vest over\nfour years. This means that you have to be around for four years to\nown all of your stock or options (from this point forward, we’ll sim-\nply refer to the equity that the entrepreneurs and employees receive\nas stock, although exactly the same logic applies to options). If you\nleave the company before the end of the four-year period, the vest-\ning formula applies and you get only a percentage of your stock. As\na result, many entrepreneurs view vesting as a way for VCs to control\nthem, their involvement, and their ownership in a company, which,\nwhile it can be true, is only a part of the story.\nA typical stock-vesting clause looks as follows:\nStock Vesting: All stock and stock equivalents issued after the\nClosing to employees, directors, consultants, and other service\nproviders will be subject to vesting provisions below unless dif-\nferent vesting is approved by the majority (including at least one\ndirector designated by the Investors) consent of the Board of"}

The\nrepurchase option shall provide that upon termination of the\nemployment of the shareholder, with or without cause, the Com-\npany or its assignee (to the extent permissible under applicable\nsecurities law qualification) retains the option to repurchase at\nthe lower of cost or the current fair market value any unvested\nshares held by such shareholder. Any issuance of shares in excess\nof the Employee Pool not approved by the Required Approval\nwill be a dilutive event requiring adjustment of the conversion\nprice as provided above and will be subject to the Investors’ first\noffer rights.\nThe outstanding Common Stock currently held by and\n(the “Founders”) will be subject to similar vesting terms pro-\nvided that the Founders shall be credited with [one year] of\nvesting as of the Closing, with their remaining unvested shares\nto vest monthly over three years.\nIndustry standard vesting for early-stage companies is a one-year\nvesting cliff and monthly vesting thereafter for a total of four years.\nThis means that if you leave before the first year is up, you haven’t\nvested any of your stock. After a year, you have vested 25% (that’s the\ncliff). Then you begin vesting monthly (or quarterly, or annually)\nover the remaining period. If you have a monthly vest with a one-\nyear cliff and you leave the company after 18 months, you’ll have\nvested 37.5% (or 18/48) of your stock.\nOften, founders will get somewhat different vesting provisions\nthan the rest of the employees. A common term is the second para-\ngraph of the example clause, where the founders receive one year of\nvesting credit at the closing of the financing and then vest the bal-\nance of their stock over the remaining 36 months. This type of vest-\ning arrangement is typical in cases where the founders have started\nthe company a year or more earlier than the VC investment and\nwant to get some credit for existing time served. In cases where the\nfounders started the company within a year of the first VC invest-\nment, they will occasionally be able to argue for vesting back to the\ninception of the company.\nUnvested stock typically disappears into the ether when some-\none leaves the company. The equity doesn’t get reallocated; rather, it"}
{"page": 77, "text": "58 Venture Deals\ngets reabsorbed and everyone (VCs, stockholders, and option hold-\ners) benefi ts ratably from the increase in ownership, also known as\nreverse dilution . In the case of founders’ stock, the unvested stuff just\nvanishes. In the case of unvested employee options, it usually goes\nback into the option pool to be reissued to future employees.\nIn some cases, founders own their stock outright through a pur-\nchase at the time that the company is established. While the descrip-\ntion of what happens to this founders’ stock is often referred to as\nvesting, it’s actually a buy-back right of the company. Though there\nare technically the same outcomes, the legal language around this is\nsomewhat different and matters for tax purposes.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nHow a founder’s stock vests is important. Although simple vesting can work,\nyou should consider alternative strategies such as allowing you to purchase your\nunvested stock at the same price as the fi nancing if you leave the company,\nprotecting your position for a termination “without cause,” or treating your vest-\ning as a clawback with an Internal Revenue Code Section 83(b) election so you\ncan lock in long-term capital gains tax rates early on (which is discussed later\nin this book).\nA key component of vesting is defi ning what, if anything, hap-\npens to vesting schedules upon a merger. S ingle-trigger acceleration\nrefers to automatic accelerated vesting upon a merger. D ouble-trigger\nacceleration refers to two events needing to take place before acceler-\nated vesting, specifi cally an acquisition of the company combined\nwith the employee in question being fi red by the acquiring company.\nIn VC-funded deals, a double trigger is much more common\nthan a single trigger. Acceleration on change of control is often a\ncontentious point of negotiation between founders and VCs, as the\nfounders will want to get all their stock in a transaction—“Hey, we\nearned it!”—and VCs will want to minimize the impact of the out-\nstanding equity on their share of the purchase price. Most acquirers\nwill want there to be some forward-looking incentive for founders,\nmanagement, and employees, so they usually prefer some unvested\nequity to exist to help motivate folks to stick around for a period of\ntime post acquisition. In the absence of this, the acquirer will include\na separate management retention incentive as part of the deal value.\nSince this management retention piece is included in the value of"}
{"page": 78, "text": "Economic Terms of the Term Sheet 59\nthe transaction, it effectively reduces the consideration that gets\nallocated to the equity owners of the company, including the VCs\nand any founders who are no longer actively involved in the com-\npany. This often frustrates VCs since it puts them at cross-purposes\nwith management in an acquisition negotiation—everyone should\nbe negotiating to maximize the value for all shareholders, not just\nspecifically for themselves. Although the actual legal language is not\nvery interesting, it is included here:\nIn the event of a merger, consolidation, sale of assets, or other\nchange of control of the Company and should an Employee\nbe terminated without cause within one year after such event,\nsuch person shall be entitled to [one year] of additional vesting.\nOther than the foregoing, there shall be no accelerated vesting\nin any event.\nStructuring acceleration on change-of-control terms used to be\na huge deal in the 1990s when pooling of interests was an accepted\nform of accounting treatment, since there were significant con-\nstraints on any modifications to vesting agreements. Pooling was\nabolished in early 2000, and under current acquisition accounting\ntreatment (also known as purchase accounting) there is no meaning-\nful accounting impact in a merger of changing the vesting arrange-\nments (including accelerating vesting). As a result, we usually recom-\nmend a balanced approach to acceleration such as a double trigger\nwith one-year acceleration and recognize that this will often be nego-\ntiated during an acquisition. It’s important to recognize that many\nVCs have a distinct point of view on this; some VCs will never do a\ndeal with single-trigger acceleration, whereas some VCs don’t really\ncare very much. As in any negotiation, make sure you are not nego-\ntiating against a point of principle, as VCs will often say, “That’s how\nit is and we won’t do anything different.”\nRecognize that vesting works for the founders as well as the VCs.\nWe have been involved in a number of situations where one founder\ndidn’t stay with the company very long either by choice or because\nthe other founders wanted her to leave the company. In these situa-\ntions, if there hadn’t been vesting provisions, the person who didn’t\nstay at the company would have walked away with all of her stock and\nthe remaining founders would have had no differential ownership\ngoing forward. By vesting each founder, there is a clear incentive to"}
{"page": 79, "text": "60 Venture Deals\nwork your hardest and participate constructively in the team, beyond\nthe elusive founder’s moral imperative. The same rule applies to\nemployees; since equity is another form of compensation, vesting is\nthe mechanism to ensure the equity is earned over time.\nTime to exit has a huge impact on the relevancy of vesting. In the\nlate 1990s, when companies often reached an exit event within two\nyears of being founded, the vesting provisions, especially accelera-\ntion clauses, mattered a huge amount to the founders. In a market\nwhere the typical gestation period of an early-stage company is fi ve\nto seven years, most people, especially founders and early employees\nwho stay with a company, will be fully (or mostly) vested at the time\nof an exit event.\nWhile it’s easy to set vesting up as a contentious issue between\nfounders and VCs, we recommend the founding entrepreneurs view\nvesting as an overall alignment tool—for themselves, their cofound-\ners, early employees, and future employees. Anyone who has expe-\nrienced an unfair vesting situation will have strong feelings about\nit; a balanced approach and consistency are key to making vesting\nprovisions work long-term in a company.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nWhile single-trigger acceleration might seem appealing, double-trigger accel-\neration with some boundaries makes a lot of sense. Any entrepreneur who has\nbeen on the buy side of an acquisition will tell you that having one or two years’\nworth of guaranteed transition on the part of an acquired management team is\ncritical to an acquisition’s fi nancial success.\nExercise Period\nOne provision that is not generally found in term sheets but that is\nclosely aligned with vesting is the concept of an e xercise period . Once\nstock is vested, a holder may exercise the option by paying the pur-\nchase price to the company. In other words, if you have an option for\n1,000 shares of stock at $0.10 a share, you can pay $100 to the com-\npany (after all the shares have vested) and own the stock outright.\nOften, current employees of a company don’t do this, as they want\nto see how successful the company will be before they use funds to"}
{"page": 80, "text": "Economic Terms of the Term Sheet 61\npurchase stock, although if the cost of exercising is low enough\nthere’s a significant tax advantage by exercising the options, as you’ll\nnow own stock that will be subject to capital gains tax treatment,\ninstead of options which are subject to ordinary income tax treatment.\nHowever, once a person leaves a company, the exercise period\ndetermines how long the departed employee has to purchase their\nstock. Historically, this time period has been 90 days. If you leave the\ncompany for any reason (voluntarily or not), then you have up to\n90 days to pay the $100 to the company for the stock; otherwise, the\nstock would be forfeited and returned to the stock option plan to be\ngranted to other employees.\nThere have been recent efforts to change this, as some feel\nit’s not fair for recently departed employees to have to pay for\ntheir options within 90 days or forfeit the stock they earned dur-\ning their employment. There are some companies which have\nchanged their exercise periods to the maximum legal amount,\nwhich is 10 years from the date of grant.\nAs a current topic, it will be interesting to see how this all works\nout. What concerns us about the extension of the exercise period is\nthat it allows people to change jobs frequently and acquire options\nin a number of companies, undermining the retention benefits\nof options. Furthermore, the ultimate balance of equity between\nearly employees who leave within a year or two, but hold on to their\noptions for a decade can get out of alignment with later employees,\nwho stay longer, but start with less options.\nAt this point, we tend to prefer to deal with this issue on a case-\nby-case basis. If the employee leaving merits this type of treatment,\nthe company can always choose to extend the exercise period as part\nof the termination agreement.\nEmployee Pool\nAnother economic term that matters, but is often not focused on\nuntil the end of the negotiation, is the employee pool (also known as\nthe option pool). The employee pool is the amount of the company\nthat is reserved for future issuance to employees. Typical language\nfollows:\nEmployee Pool: Prior to the Closing, the Company will reserve\nshares of its Common Stock so that percent of its fully diluted"}
{"page": 81, "text": "62 Venture Deals\ncapital stock following the issuance of its Series A Preferred is\navailable for future issuances to directors, officers, employees,\nand consultants. The term “Employee Pool” shall include both\nshares reserved for issuance as stated above, as well as current\noptions outstanding, which aggregate amount is approximately\n% of the Company’s fully diluted capital stock following the\nissuance of its Series A Preferred.\nThe employee pool is called out in a separate section in order to\nclarify the capital structure and specifically define the percentage of\nthe company that will be allocated to the option pool associated with\nthe financing. Since a capitalization table is almost always included\nwith the term sheet, this section is redundant, but exists so there is\nno confusion about the size of the option pool.\nIt is important to understand the impact of the size of the pool\non the valuation of the financing. As with pre-money and post-money\nvaluations, VCs often sneak in additional economics for themselves\nby increasing the amount of the option pool on a pre-money basis.\nLet’s go through an example. Assume that a $2 million financing\nis being done at a $10 million post-money valuation. In this case, the\nnew investors get 20% of the company for $2 million and the effec-\ntive post-money valuation is $10 million. Before the financing there\nis a 10% unallocated option pool. However, in the term sheet, the\ninvestors put a provision that the post financing unallocated option\npool will be 20%. This results in a post financing ownership split of\n20% to the new investors, 60% to the old shareholders, and an unal-\nlocated employee pool of 20%.\nIn contrast, if the 10% option pool that previously existed was\nsimply rolled over, the post-money allocation would still be 20% to\nnew investors, but the old shareholders would get 70% and the unal-\nlocated option pool would be 10%.\nWhile in both cases the investors end up with 20%, the old share-\nholders have 10% less ownership in the case of the 20% option pool.\nAlthough the additional ownership will ultimately end up in the\nhands of future employees, it is effectively coming out of the old\nshareholders rather than being shared between the new investors\nand the old shareholders. This will result in a lower price per share\nfor the new investors and effectively a lower pre-money valuation.\nIf the VC is pushing for a larger option pool to come out of the\npre-money valuation but the entrepreneur feels that there is enough"}
{"page": 82, "text": "Economic Terms of the Term Sheet 63\nin the pool to meet the company’s needs over the time frame of\nthis financing, the entrepreneur can say, “Look, I strongly believe we\nhave enough options to cover our needs. Let’s go with it at my pro-\nposed level and if we should need to expand the option pool before\nthe next financing, we will provide full anti-dilution protection for\nyou to cover that.”\nAntidilution\nThe final key economic provision is antidilution. A typical antidilu-\ntion clause in a term sheet follows:\nAntidilution Provisions: The conversion price of the Series A\nPreferred will be subject to a [full ratchet/broad-based/narrow\nbased weighted average] adjustment to reduce dilution in the\nevent that the Company issues additional equity securities—\nother than shares (i) reserved as employee shares described\nunder the Company’s option pool; (ii) shares issued for con-\nsideration other than cash pursuant to a merger, consolidation,\nacquisition, or similar business combination approved by the\nBoard; (iii) shares issued pursuant to any equipment loan or\nleasing arrangement, real property leasing arrangement, or debt\nfinancing from a bank or similar financial institution approved\nby the Board; and (iv) shares with respect to which the holders\nof a majority of the outstanding Series A Preferred waive their\nantidilution rights—at a purchase price less than the applicable\nconversion price. In the event of an issuance of stock involving\ntranches or other multiple closings, the antidilution adjustment\nshall be calculated as if all stock was issued at the first closing.\nThe conversion price will also be subject to proportional adjust-\nment for stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, recapitali-\nzations, and the like.\nYeah, we agree—that’s a mouthful. It’s also a clause that often\ntrips up entrepreneurs. While the antidilution provision is used to\nprotect investors in the event a company issues equity at a lower valu-\nation than in previous financing rounds, it is also an excuse for law-\nyers to use a spreadsheet. There are two varieties: weighted average\nantidilution and ratchet-based antidilution.\nFull ratchet antidilution means that if the company issues shares\nat a price lower than the price for the series with the full ratchet"}
{"page": 83, "text": "64 Venture Deals\nprovision, then the earlier round price is effectively reduced to\nthe price of the new issuance. One can get creative and do partial\nratchets, such as half ratchets or two-thirds ratchets, which are less\nharsh but rarely seen.\nFull ratchets came into vogue in the 2001–2003 time frame when\ndown rounds were all the rage, but the most common antidilution\nprovision is based on the weighted average concept, which takes\ninto account the magnitude of the lower-priced issuance, not just\nthe actual valuation. In a full ratchet world, if the company sold one\nshare of its stock to someone for a price lower than the previous\nround, all of the previous round stock would be repriced to the new\nissuance price. In a weighted average world, the number of shares\nissued at the reduced price is considered in the repricing of the pre-\nvious round. Mathematically (and this is where the lawyers get to\nshow off their math skills—although you’ll notice there are no expo-\nnents or summation signs anywhere) it works as follows:\nCSO+CSP\nNCP=OCP*\nCSO+CSAP\nwhere:\nNCP = new conversion price\nOCP = old conversion price\nCSO = common stock outstanding\nCSP = common stock purchasable with consideration\nreceived by company (i.e., what the buyer should\nhave bought if it hadn’t been a down round issuance)\nCSAP = common stock actually purchased in subsequent\nissuance (i.e., what the buyer actually bought)\nNote that despite the fact one is buying preferred stock, the cal-\nculations are always done on an as-if-converted (to common stock)\nbasis. The company is not issuing more shares; rather, it determines\na new conversion price for the previous series of stock. Alterna-\ntively, the company can issue more shares, but we think this is a silly\nand unnecessarily complicated approach that merely increases the\namount the lawyers can bill the company for the financing. Con-\nsequently, antidilution provisions usually generate a conversion price\nadjustment."}
{"page": 84, "text": "Economic Terms of the Term Sheet 65\nYou might note the term broad-based in describing weighted aver-\nage anti-dilution. What makes the provision broad-based versus nar-\nrow-based is the definition of common stock outstanding (CSO). A\nbroad-based weighted average provision encompasses both the com-\npany’s common stock outstanding (including all common stock issu-\nable upon conversion of its preferred stock) as well as the number\nof shares of common stock that could be obtained by converting all\nother options, rights, and securities (including employee options).\nA narrow-based provision will not include these other convertible\nsecurities and will limit the calculation to only currently outstanding\nsecurities. The number of shares and how you count them matter;\nmake sure you are agreeing on the same definition, as you’ll often\nfind different lawyers arguing over what to include or not include in\nthe definitions.\nIn our example language, we’ve included a section that is gener-\nally referred to as “antidilution carve-outs”—the section “other than\nshares (i) . . . (iv).” These are the standard exceptions for shares\ngranted at lower prices for which anti-dilution does not apply. From\na company and entrepreneur perspective, more exceptions are bet-\nter, and most investors will accept these carve-outs without much\nargument.\nOne particular item to note is the last carve-out:\n(iv) shares with respect to which the holders of a majority of the\noutstanding Series A Preferred waive their antidilution rights.\nThis is a carve-out that started appearing recently, which we have\nfound to be very helpful in deals where a majority of the Series A\ninvestors agree to further fund a company in a follow-on financing,\nbut the price will be lower than the original Series A. In this exam-\nple, several minority investors signaled they were not planning to\ninvest in the new round, as they would have preferred to sit back\nand increase their ownership stake via the anti-dilution provision.\nHaving the larger investors (the majority of the class) step up and\nvote to carve the financing out of the antidilution terms was a bonus\nfor the company common stockholders and employees, who would\nhave suffered the dilution of additional anti-dilution from investors\nwho were not continuing to participate in financing the company.\nThis approach encourages the minority investors to participate in\nthe round in order to protect themselves from dilution."}
{"page": 85, "text": "66 Venture Deals\nOccasionally, antidilution will be absent in a Series A term sheet.\nInvestors love precedent (e.g., the new investor says, “I want what\nthe last guy got, plus more”). In many cases, antidilution provisions\nhurt Series A investors more than later investors if you assume the\nSeries A price is the low-water mark for the company. For instance,\nif the Series A price is $1, the Series B price is $5, and the Series C\nprice is $3, then the Series B benefits from the antidilution provision\nat the expense of the Series A. Our experience is that antidilution\nis usually requested despite this, as Series B investors will most likely\nalways ask for it and, since they do, the Series A investors proactively\nask for it anyway.\nIn addition to economic impacts, antidilution provisions can\nhave control impacts. First, the existence of an antidilution provision\nwill motivate the company to issue new rounds of stock at higher\nvaluations because of the impact of antidilution protection on the\ncommon stockholders. In some cases, a company may pass on taking\nan additional investment at a lower valuation, although practically\nspeaking, this happens only when a company has other alternatives\nto the financing. A recent phenomenon is to tie antidilution calcu-\nlations to milestones the investors have set for the company, result-\ning in a conversion price adjustment in the case that the company\ndoes not meet certain revenue, product development, or other busi-\nness milestones. In this situation, the antidilution adjustment occurs\nautomatically if the company does not meet its objectives, unless the\ninvestor waives it after the fact. This creates a powerful incentive for\nthe company to accomplish its investor-determined goals. We tend to\navoid this approach, as blindly hitting predetermined product and\nsales milestones set at the time of a financing is not always best for\nthe long-term development of a company, especially if these goals\nend up creating a diverging set of objectives between management\nand the investors as the business evolves.\nAntidilution provisions are almost always part of a financing, so\nunderstanding the nuances and knowing which aspects to negotiate\nare an important part of the entrepreneur’s tool kit. We advise you\nnot to get hung up in trying to eliminate antidilution provisions.\nInstead, focus on minimizing their impact and building value in\nyour company after the financing so they don’t ever come into play."}

Venture capitalists (VCs) care about control provisions\nin order to keep an eye on their investments as well as comply with\ncertain federal tax statutes that are a result of the types of investors\nthat invest in VC funds. Some control provisions are necessary to\nprevent VCs from running afoul of the fi duciary duties they owe to\nboth their investors and the companies they invest in. While VCs\noften have less than 50% ownership of a company, they usually have\na variety of control terms that effectively give them control of many\nactivities of the company.\nIn this chapter we discuss the following terms: board of directors,\nprotective provisions, drag-along rights, and conversion.\nBoard of Directors\nOne of the key control mechanisms is the process for electing the\nboard of directors. The entrepreneur should think carefully about\nwhat the proper balance should be among investor, company,\nfounder, and outside representation on the board.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nElecting a board of directors is an important, and delicate, point. Your board is\nyour inner sanctum, your strategic planning department, and your judge, jury,\nand executioner all at once. Some VCs are terrible board members, even if\nthey’re good investors and nice people.\n67"}
{"page": 87, "text": "68 Venture Deals\nA typical board of directors clause follows:\nBoard of Directors: The size of the Company’s Board of Direc-\ntors shall be set at [X]. The Board shall initially be comprised\nof __________, as the Investor representative[s] _________,\n_________, and __________. At each meeting for the election\nof directors, the holders of the Series A Preferred, voting as a\nseparate class, shall be entitled to elect [X] member[s] of the\nCompany’s Board of Directors which director shall be designated\nby Investor, the holders of Common Stock, voting as a separate\nclass, shall be entitled to elect [X] member[s], and the remaining\ndirectors will be [Option 1: mutually agreed upon by the Com-\nmon and Preferred, voting together as a single class] [or Option\n2: chosen by the mutual consent of the Board of Directors].\nIf a subset of the board is being chosen by more than one constit-\nuency (e.g., two directors chosen by the investors, two by founders\nor common stockholders, and one by mutual consent), you should\nconsider what is best: chosen by mutual consent of the board (one\nperson, one vote) or voted upon on the basis of proportional share\nownership on a common-as-converted basis.\nVCs will often want to include a board observer as part of the\nagreement either instead of or in addition to an offi cial member of\nthe board. The value of this will depend on who the observer is. With\nmany VC fi rms, the observer will be an associate in the fi rm. In these\ncases, some will be just there to learn (and in the worst cases talk about\nboard topics to their friends over beers in order to look cool and\nimportant), while others are immensely helpful. You’ll even run into\nobservers who are more helpful than the VC partner on your board.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nBe wary of observers. Sometimes they add no value yet they do take up seats at\nthe table. Often, it’s not about who votes at a board meeting, but the discussion\nthat occurs, so observers can sway the balance of a board. You don’t want to\nfi nd yourself with a pre-revenue company and 15 people around the table at a\nboard meeting.\nMany investors will mandate that one of the board members\nchosen by common stockholders be the then-serving CEO of the"}

This can be tricky if the CEO is the same as one of the\nkey founders (often you’ll see language giving the right to a board\nseat to one of the founders and a separate board seat to the then\nCEO), consuming two of the common board seats. Then, if the CEO\nchanges, so does that board seat.\nLet’s go through two examples: an early-stage board for a\ncompany that has raised its first round of capital and the board\nof a company that is mature and contemplating an initial public\noffering (IPO).\nIn the case of the early-stage board, there will often be three to\nfive board members:\nThe three-person board will typically consist of:\n1. Founder/CEO\n2. VC\n3. An outside board member, or perhaps another founder\nThe five-person board will typically consist of:\n1. Founder\n2. CEO\n3. VC\n4. A second VC\n5. An outside board member\nThese are the default cases for a balanced board that gives the\nVC enough influence to be comfortable without having control over\nthe board. Correspondingly, the founder(s) and CEO will have the\nsame number of seats as the VCs, and the outside board member will\nbe able to help resolve any conflicts that arise as well as be a legiti-\nmately independent board member.\nIn the case of a mature board, you’ll typically see more board\nmembers (seven to nine) with more outside board members. The\nCEO and one of the founders are on this board along with a few of\nthe VCs (depending on the amount of money raised). However, the\nmajority of the additions to the board are outside board members,\ntypically experienced entrepreneurs or executives in the domain in\nwhich the company is operating.\nWhile it is appropriate for board members and observers to be\nreimbursed for their reasonable out-of-pocket costs for attending"}
{"page": 89, "text": "70 Venture Deals\nboard meetings, we rarely see board members receive cash com-\npensation for serving on the board of a private company. Outside\nboard members are usually compensated with stock options—just\nlike key employees—and are often invited to invest money in the\ncompany alongside the VCs. Usually you see these outsiders receive\noptions to purchase 0.25% to 0.5% of the company that vest over\ntwo to four years.\nWe are of the opinion that VCs don’t want to control boards of\nportfolio companies. If the board votes are really that contentious\nthen the company is in serious trouble. Instead of controlling the\nboard, VCs generally use protective provisions, which we will discuss in\nthe next section, to provide the control they want over the company.\nWe are also of the opinion that the founders are better off not\ncontrolling the board, either. Having an outside board member can\nbe invaluable for certain corporate governance issues that one will\nwant an impartial vote for. Also, having a true outside board member\nwill bring diversity of thought that most insiders (including both the\ncommon and preferred holders) won’t bring to the board room.\nIf you are interested in learning a lot more about how boards of\ndirectors work, and more importantly how to make them useful, get\na copy of one of Brad’s other books (edited by Jason), titled Startup\nBoards: Getting the Most Out of Your Board of Directors.\nProtective Provisions\nThe next key control term you will encounter in the term sheet is\nprotective provisions. Protective provisions are effectively veto rights\nthat investors have on certain actions by the company. Not surpris-\ningly, these provisions protect VCs, although unfortunately not from\nthemselves.\nOnce upon a time, the protective provisions were often hotly\nnegotiated but over time have mostly become standardized. Entre-\npreneurs would like to see few or no protective provisions in their\ndocuments. In contrast, VCs would like to have some veto-level con-\ntrol over a set of actions the company could take, especially when it\nimpacts the VCs’ economic position.\nA typical protective provision clause looks as follows:\nFor so long as any shares of Series A Preferred remain outstand-\ning, consent of the Required Percentage of the Series A Preferred\nshall be required for any action, whether directly or though"}

Another easily accepted change is to add\na minimum threshold of preferred shares outstanding for the pro-\ntective provisions to apply, keeping the protective provisions from\nlingering on forever when the capital structure is changed—through\neither a positive or a negative event.\nMany company counsels will ask for m ateriality qualifi ers —for\ninstance, that the word m aterial or materially be inserted in front of\nsubsections (i), (ii), and (vi) in the example. We always decline this\nrequest, not to be stubborn, but because we don’t really know what\nmaterial means (if you ask a judge or read any case law, that will not\nhelp you, either), and we believe that specifi city is more important\nthan debating reasonableness. Remember that these are protective\nprovisions; they don’t eliminate the ability to do these things, but\nsimply require consent of the investors. As long as things are not\nmaterial from the VC’s point of view, the consent to do these things\nwill be granted. We’d always rather be clear up front what the rules\nof engagement are rather than have a debate over what the word\nmaterial means in the middle of a situation where these protective\nprovisions might come into play. Finally, there have been several\nlegal cases in the last decade that have all gone against VCs for not\ndrafting language that is specifi c.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nAs far as the example protective provision clause is concerned, (i) fair is fair;\n(ii) fair is fair; (iii) fair is fair; (iv) this should be positive for VCs, but not a\nbig deal; (v) this is critical as long as Series A preferred holders represent, in\naggregate, enough of your capitalization table to be relevant; (vi) makes sense;\n(vii) this is critical as long as Series A preferred holders represent, in aggregate,\nenough of your cap table to be relevant; (viii) you will never have to worry about\nthis; (ix) this is fi ne, though you should try to get a higher limit or an exclusion\nfor equipment fi nancing in the normal course of business; (x) and (xi) are fi ne.\nWhen future fi nancing rounds occur (e.g., Series B, a new class\nof preferred stock), there is always a discussion as to how the protec-\ntive provisions will work with regard to the new class. There are two\ncases: the Series B gets its own protective provisions or the Series B\ninvestors vote alongside the original investors as a single class. Entre-\npreneurs almost always will want a single vote for all the investors, as"}
{"page": 92, "text": "Control Terms of the Term Sheet 73\nthe separate investor class protective provision vote means the com-\npany now has two classes of potential veto constituents to deal with.\nNormally, new investors will ask for a separate vote, as their interests\nmay diverge from those of the original investors due to different\npricing, different risk profi les, and a false need for overall control.\nHowever, many experienced investors will align with the entrepre-\nneur’s point of view of not wanting separate class votes, as they do\nnot want the potential headaches of another equity class vetoing\nan important company action. If Series B investors are the same as\nSeries A investors, this is an irrelevant discussion and it should be\neasy for everyone to default to voting as a single class. If you have\nnew investors in the Series B, be wary of inappropriate veto rights\nfor small investors; for example, the consent percentage required\nis 90% instead of a majority (50.1%), enabling a new investor who\nowns only 10.1 percent of the fi nancing to effectively assert control\nover the protective provisions through his vote.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nRegardless of who your investors are, fi ght to have them vote as a single class.\nIt’s critical for your sanity. It keeps investors aligned. And as long as your capi-\ntalization table is rational, it won’t matter.\nSome investors feel they have enough control with their board\ninvolvement to ensure that the company does not take any action\ncontrary to their interests, and as a result will not focus on these\nprotective provisions. During a fi nancing this is the typical argu-\nment used by company counsel to try to convince the VCs to back\noff of some or all of the protective provisions. We think this is a\nshortsighted approach for the investor, since, as a board member, an\ninvestor designee has legal duties (tirelessly referred to in moments\nof confl ict as a fi duciary duty ) to work in the best interests of the com-\npany. At the same time, VCs also have a fi duciary duty to their inves-\ntors as well. Sometimes the interests of the company and a particular\nclass of shareholders diverge. Therefore, there can be times when\nan individual would legally have to approve something as a board\nmember in the best interests of the company as a whole and not\nhave a protective provision to fall back on as a shareholder. While\nthis dynamic does not necessarily benefi t the entrepreneur, it’s good"}
{"page": 93, "text": "74 Venture Deals\ngovernance as it functionally separates the duties of a board member\nfrom those of a shareholder, shining a brighter light on an area of\npotential confl ict.\nWhile one could make the argument that protective provisions\nare at the core of the trust between a VC and an entrepreneur, we\nthink that’s a hollow and naive statement. When an entrepreneur\nasks, “Don’t you trust me? Why do we need these things?” the simple\nanswer is that it is not an issue of trust. Rather, we like to eliminate the\ndiscussion about who ultimately gets to make which decisions before\nwe do a deal. Eliminating the ambiguity in roles, control, and rules\nof engagement is an important part of any fi nancing, and the protec-\ntive provisions cut to the heart of this. As discussed in Chap ter 15 ,\nall of this legal activity is an attempt to clarify the rules of engagement\nand align incentives between investors and entrepreneurs.\nOccasionally the protective provisions can help the entrepre-\nneur, especially in an acquisition scenario. Since the investor can\neffectively block a sale of the company, this provides the entrepre-\nneur with some additional leverage when negotiating with the buyer\nsince the price needs to be high enough to garner the VC’s consent\non the deal. Of course, this assumes a reasonable position from the\nexisting investor, but in most cases an experienced VC will support\nthe entrepreneur’s decision to sell a company.\nA decade ago the protective provisions took several days to nego-\ntiate. Over time these provisions have been hotly tested in courts\nof law from several important judicial decisions, so today they have\nbecome mostly boilerplate with the only extended negotiation often\nbeing around the word materiality.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nRemember, you are negotiating this deal on behalf of the company (no matter\nwho runs it in the future) and with the investors (no matter who owns the shares\nin the future). These terms are not only about your current relationship with the\nVC in question.\nDrag-Along Agreement\nAnother important control provision is the d rag-along agreement .\nUnder certain circumstances, the company will not want a specifi c\nshareholder to vote his shares in whatever way the shareholder wants,"}
{"page": 94, "text": "Control Terms of the Term Sheet 75\nbut instead prefers to have the shares voted by a certain investor or\nclass of investors. Unless a shareholder is on the board, she gener-\nally doesn’t have a legal duty to keep the company’s best interests\nin mind.\nThere are two general flavors of drag-along agreements. The\nfirst is where the preferred investors drag-along the common share-\nholders. This agreement gives the preferred investors the ability to\nforce, or drag along, all of the other investors and the founders to\ndo a sale of the company, regardless of how the folks being dragged\nalong feel about the deal.\nTypical language follows:\nDrag-Along Agreement: The [holders of the Common Stock] or\n[Founders] and Series A Preferred shall enter into a drag-along\nagreement whereby if a majority of the holders of Series A Pre-\nferred agree to a sale or liquidation of the Company, the holders\nof the remaining Series A Preferred and Common Stock shall\nconsent to and raise no objections to such sale.\nAfter the Internet bubble burst of the early 2000s and sales\nof companies started occurring that were at or below the liquida-\ntion preferences, entrepreneurs and founders—not surprisingly—\nstarted to resist selling the company in these situations since they\noften weren’t getting anything in the deal. While there are several\nmechanisms to address sharing consideration below the liquidation\npreferences, such as the notion of a carve-out, which we’ll discuss\nlater, the fundamental issue is that if a transaction occurs below the\nliquidation preferences, it’s likely that some or all of the VCs are los-\ning money on the transaction. The VC point of view on this varies\nwidely and is often dependent on the situation; some VCs can deal\nwith this and are happy to provide some consideration to manage-\nment to get a deal done, whereas others are stubborn in their view\nthat since they lost money, management and founders shouldn’t\nreceive anything.\nIn each of these situations, the VCs would much rather control\ntheir ability to compel other shareholders to support the transac-\ntion. As more of these situations appeared, the major holders of\ncommon stock (even when they were in the minority of ownership)\nbegan refusing to vote for the proposed transaction unless the hold-\ners of preferred stock waived part of their liquidation preferences in"}
{"page": 95, "text": "76 Venture Deals\nfavor of the common stock. Needless to say, this particular holdout\ntechnique did not go over well in the venture community and, as a\nresult, the drag-along agreement became more prevalent.\nMore recently, a second flavor of drag-along has come to exist\nand it is one that we prefer. In this version, if a founder leaves the\ncompany, their stock will be dragged along by all other classes of\nstock. In other words, a departed founder (who may or may not har-\nbor ill will toward the company) cannot play the hold out on voting\nmatters. Typical language looks like this:\nDrag-Along Agreement: When a Founder leaves the Company,\nsuch Founder shall agree to vote his Common Stock or Series A\nPreferred (or Common Stock acquired on conversion of Series\nA or Former Series A Preferred) in the same proportion as all\nother shares are voted in any vote.\nNote that the dragged along shares are voted in proportion to\nall the other votes cast. So if the vote is 90% yes and 10% no, the\ndeparted founder’s shares will be voted in a 90/10 split.\nIf you are faced with a drag-along situation, your ownership posi-\ntion will determine whether or not this is an important issue for you.\nAn acquisition does not require unanimous consent of shareholders;\nthese rules vary by jurisdiction, although the two most common situ-\nations are either majority of each class (California) or majority of all\nshares on an as-converted basis (Delaware). However, most acquirers\nwill want 85% to 90% of shareholders to consent to a transaction. If\nyou own one percent of a company and the VCs would like you to\nsign up to a drag-along agreement, it doesn’t matter much unless\nthere are 30 of you who each own one percent. Make sure you know\nwhat you are fighting for in the negotiation, and don’t put dispro-\nportionate energy against terms that don’t matter.\nWhen a company is faced with the first flavor of a drag-along\nagreement in a VC financing proposal, the most common compro-\nmise position is to try to get the drag-along rights to pertain to follow-\ning the majority of the common stock, not the preferred. This way, if\nyou own common stock, you are dragged along only when a majority\nof the common stockholders consent to the transaction. This is a\ngraceful position for a very small investor to take (e.g., “I’ll play ball\nif a majority of the common plays ball”) and one that we’ve always\nbeen willing to take when we’ve owned common stock in a company\n(e.g., “I’m not going to stand in the way of something a majority of"}
{"page": 96, "text": "Control Terms of the Term Sheet 77\nfolks who have rights equal to me want to do”). Of course, preferred\ninvestors can always convert some of their holdings to common stock\nto generate a majority, but this also results in a benefi t to the com-\nmon stockholders as it lowers the overall liquidation preference.\nDuring the term sheet negotiation, pay attention to what your\nlawyer might be saying to your investor during the negotiation of\na drag-along. We’ve seen many lawyers slam their fi sts on the table\nrejecting any notion of a drag-along. While we clearly understand\nthe argument why a drag-along might not be in the best interests of\nan individual, it’s hard for us to see how this is not in the best inter-\nests of the company. In that instance we being to wonder whether\nthe lawyer is representing the company—who they should be rep-\nresenting—or the founder(s). While nuanced, the dynamic can be\nprofoundly important, especially when there is confl ict between a\nfounder and the company.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nThis is one of those terms that matter most if things are falling apart, in which\ncase you probably have bigger fi sh to fry. And it cuts both ways—if you have a lot\nof investors, for example, this term can force them all to agree to a deal, which\nmight save you from a lot of agitation down the road. Of course, it is best to not\nbe in a fi re sale situation, or at least to have enough board members whom you\ncontrol (at least effectively, if not contractually) so that you can prevent a bad\ndeal from happening in the fi rst place.\nConversion\nWhile many VCs posture during term sheet negotiations by saying\nthings like “That is nonnegotiable,” terms rarely are. Occasionally,\nthough, a term will actually be nonnegotiable, and conversion is one\nsuch term.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nAmen. “This is nonnegotiable” is usually a phrase thrown out by junior mem-\nbers of VC fi rms when they don’t know any better. In particular, watch out for\nthe “This is how we always do deals” or “This is a standard deal term for us”\nnegotiating tactic as being ultra-lame and a sign that the people you’re negotiat-\ning with don’t really know what they are doing."}
{"page": 97, "text": "78 Venture Deals\nIn all the VC deals we’ve ever seen, the preferred shareholders\nhave the right—at any time—to convert their stake into common\nstock. Following is the standard language:\nConversion: The holders of the Series A Preferred shall have the\nright to convert the Series A Preferred, at any time, into shares\nof Common Stock. The initial conversion rate shall be 1:1, sub-\nject to adjustment as provided below.\nAs we discussed in the liquidation preferences section, this allows\nthe buyers of preferred to convert to common should they deter-\nmine on a liquidation that they would be better off getting paid on\nan as-converted common basis rather than accepting the liquidation\npreference and the participation amount. It can also be used in cer-\ntain extreme circumstances whereby the preferred wants to control\na vote of the common on a certain issue. Note, however, that once\nconverted, there is no provision for reconverting back to preferred.\nA more interesting term is the automatic conversion, especially\nsince it has several components that are negotiable.\nAutomatic Conversion: All of the Series A Preferred shall be\nautomatically converted into Common Stock, at the then appli-\ncable conversion price, upon the closing of a firmly underwrit-\nten public offering of shares of Common Stock of the Company\nat a per share price not less than [three] times the Original Pur-\nchase Price (as adjusted for stock splits, dividends, and the like)\nper share and for a total offering of not less than [$15] million\n(before deduction of underwriters’ commissions and expenses)\n(a “Qualified IPO”). All, or a portion of each share, of the Series\nA Preferred shall be automatically converted into Common\nStock, at the then applicable conversion price in the event that\nthe holders of at least a majority of the outstanding Series A Pre-\nferred consent to such conversion.\nIn an IPO of a venture-backed company, the investment bank-\ners will almost always want to see everyone convert into common\nstock at the time of the IPO. It is rare for a venture-backed company\nto go public with multiple classes of stock, although occasionally\nyou will see dual classes of shares in an IPO as Google had. The\nthresholds for the automatic conversion are critical to negotiate. As"}

There are many horror stories of\ncompanies on the brink of going public with one class of preferred\nstockholders having a threshold above what the proposed offering\nwould result in; as a result, these stockholders have an effective veto\nright on the offering.\nFor example, assume that you have an early-stage investor with\nan automatic conversion threshold of $30 million and a later-stage\ninvestor with an automatic conversion threshold of $60 million. Now,\nassume you are at the goal line for an IPO and it’s turning out to be\na $50 million offering based on the market and the demand for your\ncompany. Your early investor is ready to go, but your later-stage inves-\ntor suddenly says, “I’d like a little something else since I can block\nthe deal and even though you’ve done all of this work to get to an\nIPO, I don’t think I can support it unless . . .” In these cases, much\nlast-minute legal and fi nancial wrangling ensues given the lack of\nalignment between your different classes of investors. To avoid this,\nwe strongly recommend that you equalize the automatic conversion\nthreshold among all series of stock at each fi nancing.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nUnderstand what the norms are for new IPOs before you dig your heels in on\nconversion terms. There’s no reason to negotiate away other more critical terms\nover a $20 million threshold versus a $30 million threshold if the norm is $50\nmillion. Besides, a board decision to pursue an IPO will put pressure on a VC to\nwaive this provision."}

As we get further\ninto the term sheet, we start to encounter some terms that don’t\nmatter as much, are only impactful in a downside scenario, or don’t\nmatter at all.\nThis chapter covers those terms, which include dividends,\nredemption rights, conditions precedent to financing, information\nrights, registration rights, right of first refusal, voting rights, restric-\ntion on sales, proprietary information and inventions agreement,\nco-sale agreement, founders’ activities, initial public offering shares\npurchase, no-shop agreement, indemnification, and assignment.\nDividends\nWhereas private equity investors love dividends, most venture capi-\ntalists, especially early-stage ones, don’t really care about them. In\nour experience, the venture capitalists (VCs) who do care about divi-\ndends either come from a private equity background or are focused\non downside protection in larger deals.\nTypical dividend language in a term sheet follows:\nDividends: The holders of the Series A Preferred shall be enti-\ntled to receive [non]cumulative dividends in preference to any\ndividend on the Common Stock at the rate of [8%] of the Origi-\nnal Purchase Price per annum [when and as declared by the\nBoard of Directors]. The holders of Series A Preferred also shall\n81"}
{"page": 100, "text": "82 Venture Deals\nbe entitled to participate pro rata in any dividends paid on the\nCommon Stock on an as-if-converted basis.\nFor early-stage investments, dividends generally do not provide\nventure returns—they are simply additional juice in a deal. Let’s do\nsome simple math. Assume a typical dividend of 10% (dividends will\nrange from 5 to 15% depending on how aggressive your investor is;\nwe picked 10% to make the math easy).\nNow, assume that the VC has negotiated hard and gotten a 10%\ncumulative annual dividend. In this case, the VC automatically gets\nthe dividend every year. To keep the math simple, let’s assume the\ndividend does not compound. As a result, each year the VC gets 10%\nof the investment as a dividend. Assume a home run deal such as\na 50× return on a $10 million investment in five years. Even with a\n10% cumulative annual dividend, this increases the VC’s return from\n$500 million to only $505 million (the annual dividend is $1 million,\nor 10% of $10 million, times five years).\nWhile the extra money from the dividend is nice, it doesn’t really\nimpact the success case. Since venture funds typically have a 10-year\nlife, the dividend generates another 1× return only if you invest on\nday one of a fund and hold the investment for 10 years.\nThis also assumes the company can actually pay out the dividend.\nUsually the dividends can be paid in either stock or cash, typically at\nthe option of the company. Obviously, the dividend could drive addi-\ntional dilution if it is paid out in stock, so this is the one case in which\nit is important not to get head-faked by the investor, where the divi-\ndend becomes another form of anti-dilution protection—one that is\nautomatic and simply linked to the passage of time.\nWe are being optimistic about the return scenarios. In down-\nside cases, the dividend can matter, especially as the invested capital\nincreases. For example, take a $40 million investment with a 10%\nannual cumulative dividend in a company that was sold at the end\nof the fifth year to another company for $80 million. In this case,\nassume that there was a simple liquidation preference with no par-\nticipation and the investor got 40% of the company for his invest-\nment (at a $100 million post-money valuation). Since the sale price\nwas below the investment post-money valuation (i.e., a loser, but not\na disaster), the investor will exercise the liquidation preference and\ntake the $40 million plus the dividend ($4 million per year for five\nyears, or $20 million). In this case, the difference between the return"}
{"page": 101, "text": "Other Terms of the Term Sheet 83\nin a no-dividend scenario ($40 million) and a dividend scenario\n($60 million) is material.\nMathematically, the larger the investment amount and the lower\nthe expected exit multiple, the more the dividend matters. This is\nwhy you see dividends in private equity and buyout deals where large\ninvestments are involved (typically greater than $50 million) and the\nexpectation for return multiples on invested capital is lower.\nAutomatic dividends have some nasty side effects, especially if the\ncompany runs into trouble, since they typically should be included\nin the solvency analysis. If you aren’t paying attention, an automatic\ncumulative dividend can put you unknowingly into the zone of insol-\nvency, which is a bad place to be. Cumulative dividends can also be\nan accounting nightmare, especially when they are optionally paid\nin stock, cash, or a conversion adjustment, but that’s why the accoun-\ntants get paid the big bucks at the end of the year to put together the\naudited balance sheet.\nThat said, the noncumulative dividend when declared by the\nboard is benign, rarely declared, and an artifact of the past, so\nwe typically leave it in term sheets just to give the lawyers some-\nthing to do.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nThe thing to care about here is ensuring that dividends have to be approved by\na majority—or even a supermajority—of your board of directors.\nRedemption Rights\nEven though redemption rights rarely come into play, some VCs\nare often overly focused on them in the deal because they provide\nadditional downside protection. A typical redemption rights clause\nfollows:\nRedemption at Option of Investors: At the election of the hold-\ners of at least a majority of the Series A Preferred, the Company\nshall redeem the outstanding Series A Preferred in three annual\ninstallments beginning on the [fi fth] anniversary of the Closing.\nSuch redemptions shall be at a purchase price equal to the Orig-\ninal Purchase Price plus declared and unpaid dividends."}
{"page": 102, "text": "84 Venture Deals\nThere is some rationale for redemption rights. First, there is\nthe fear (on the VC’s part) that a company will become successful\nenough to be an ongoing business but not quite successful enough\nto go public or be acquired. In this case, redemption rights were\ninvented to allow the investor a guaranteed exit path. However, a\ncompany that is around for a while as a going concern while not\nbeing an attractive initial public offering (IPO) or acquisition can-\ndidate generally won’t have the cash to pay out redemption rights.\nAnother reason for redemption rights pertains to the life span\nof venture funds. The average venture fund has a 10-year life span\nto conduct its business. If a VC makes an investment in year five of\nthe fund, it might be important for that fund manager to secure\nredemption rights in order to have a liquidity path before the fund\nmust wind down. As with the previous case, whether or not the com-\npany has the ability to pay is another matter.\nOften, companies will claim that redemption rights create lia-\nbilities on their balance sheets and can make certain business optics\nmore difficult. By optics, we mean how certain third-parties view\nthe health and stability of the company such as bankers, custom-\ners, and employees. In the past few years, accountants have begun\nto argue more strongly that redeemable preferred stock is a liabil-\nity on the balance sheet instead of an equity feature. Unless the\nredeemable preferred stock is mandatorily redeemable, this is not\nthe case, and most experienced accountants will be able to recog-\nnize the difference.\nThere is one form of redemption that we have seen in the past\nfew years that we view as overreaching—the adverse change redemp-\ntion. We recommend you never agree to the following term that has\nrecently crept into term sheets:\nAdverse Change Redemption: Should the Company experience\na material adverse change to its prospects, business, or financial\nposition, the holders of at least a majority of the Series A Pre-\nferred shall have the option to commit the Company to immedi-\nately redeem the outstanding Series A Preferred. Such redemp-\ntion shall be at a purchase price equal to the Original Purchase\nPrice plus declared and unpaid dividends.\nThis term effectively gives the VC a right to a redemption in the\ncase of a “material adverse change to its . . . business.” The problem"}
{"page": 103, "text": "Other Terms of the Term Sheet 85\nis that “material adverse change” is not defi ned, is a vague concept,\nis too punitive, and shifts an inappropriate amount of control to\nthe investors based on an arbitrary judgment of the investors. If this\nterm is being proposed and you are getting resistance on eliminat-\ning it, make sure you are speaking to a professional investor and not\na loan shark.\nIn our experience, redemption rights are well understood by\nVCs and should not create a problem, except in a theoretical argu-\nment between lawyers and accountants.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nI don’t worry about redemption rights much, although the adverse change\nredemption clause is evil. As with dividends, just make sure you have maxi-\nmum protection around your board, or all classes of preferred shareholders\nvoting in aggregate, and not just the majority of a random class of shareholder\ndeclaring these.\nConditions Precedent to Financing\nWhile there is a lot to negotiate, a term sheet is simply a step on\nthe way to an actual deal. Term sheets are often nonbinding (or\nmostly nonbinding) and most VCs will load them up with conditions\nprecedent to fi nancing. Entrepreneurs glance over these, usually\nbecause they are in the back sections of the term sheet and seem\npretty innocuous, but they occasionally have additional ways out of a\ndeal for the investor that the entrepreneur should watch for, if only\nto better understand the current mindset of the investor proposing\nthe investment.\nA typical conditions precedent to fi nancing clause looks like this:\nConditions Precedent to Financing: Except for the provisions\ncontained herein entitled “Legal Fees and Expenses,” “No-Shop\nAgreement,” and “Governing Law,” which are explicitly agreed\nby the Investors and the Company to be binding upon execu-\ntion of this term sheet, this summary of terms is not intended\nas a legally binding commitment by the Investors, and any obli-\ngation on the part of the Investors is subject to the following\nconditions precedent: 1. Completion of legal documentation"}
{"page": 104, "text": "86 Venture Deals\nsatisfactory to the prospective Investors; 2. Satisfactory comple-\ntion of due diligence by the prospective Investors; 3. Delivery of a\ncustomary management rights letter to Investors; and 4. Submis-\nsion of a detailed budget for the following twelve (12) months,\nacceptable to Investors.\nNote that the investors will try to make a few things binding—\nspecifi cally that legal fees get paid whether or not a deal happens,\nthe company can’t shop the deal once the term sheet is signed, or\nthe governing law be set to a specifi c domicile—while explicitly stat-\ning that a bunch of things still have to happen before this deal is\ndone, and they can back out for any reason.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nTry to avoid conditions precedent to fi nancing as much as possible. Again, the\nbest Plan A has the strongest Plan B standing behind it. Your prospective VC\nshould be willing to move quickly and snap up your deal on acceptable terms\nby the time the VC gets to a term sheet. At a minimum, do not agree to pay for\nthe VC’s legal fees unless the deal is completed (with a possible carve-out for\nyou canceling the deal).\nThere are three conditions to watch out for since they usually\nsignal something nonobvious on the part of the VC. They are:\n1. Approval by investors’ partnerships. This is secret VC code for\n“This deal has not been approved by the investors who issued\nthis term sheet.” Therefore, even if you love the terms of\nthe deal, you still may not have a deal. Note that we’ve seen\ncases where this isn’t explicitly put in the term sheet but is\nstill the case. When signing a term sheet, always ask your VC\nwhether the terms have been approved by the partnership\nor if there is another approval step in the process. Be cau-\ntious of agreeing to go forward exclusively with a VC in situ-\nations where you still have additional approval steps in their\npartnership process.\n2. Rights offering to be completed by company . This indicates that the\nVCs want to offer all previous investors in the company the\nability to participate in the currently contemplated fi nanc-\ning. This is not necessarily a bad thing, as in most cases it"}

Employment agreements signed by founders as acceptable to investors .\nBe aware of what the full terms are before signing the agree-\nment. As an entrepreneur, when faced with this, it’s probably\nwise to understand and negotiate the form of employment\nagreement early in the process. You’ll want to try to do this\nbefore you sign a term sheet and accept a no-shop clause,\nbut most VCs will wave you off and say, “Don’t worry about\nit—we’ll come up with something that works for everyone.”\nMake sure you understand the key terms such as compensa-\ntion and what happens if you get fi red.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nInsist on spelling out key terms prior to a signed term sheet if it has a no-shop\nclause in it. A VC who won’t spell out key employment terms at the beginning\nis a big red fl ag.\nThere are plenty of other wacky conditions—if you can dream it\nup, it has probably been done. Just make sure to look carefully at this\nparagraph and remember that you don’t necessarily have a deal just\nbecause you’ve signed a term sheet.\nInformation Rights\nWe are back to another ubiquitous term that is important to the VC\nbut shouldn’t matter much to the entrepreneur. Information rights\ndefi ne the type of information the VC legally has access to and the\ntime frame in which the company is required to deliver it to the VC.\nInformation Rights: So long as an Investor continues to hold\n[any] shares of Series A Preferred or Common Stock issued\nupon conversion of the Series A Preferred, the Company shall\ndeliver to the Investor the Company’s annual budget, as well as\naudited annual and unaudited quarterly fi nancial statements.\nFurthermore, as soon as reasonably possible, the Company shall\nfurnish a report to each Investor comparing each annual budget\nto such fi nancial statements. Each Investor shall also be entitled"}
{"page": 106, "text": "88 Venture Deals\nto standard inspection and visitation rights. These provisions\nshall terminate upon a Qualifi ed IPO.\nYou might ask, “If these terms rarely matter, why bother?” Since\nyou will end up having to deal with them in a VC term sheet, you\nmight as well be exposed to them and hear that they don’t matter\nmuch. Of course, from a VC perspective, “doesn’t matter much” can\nalso mean “Mr. Entrepreneur, please don’t pay much attention to\nthese terms—just accept them as is.” However, our view is that if an\ninvestor or the company is hotly negotiating this particular term,\nthat time (and lawyer money) is most likely being wasted.\nInformation rights are generally something companies are stuck\nwith in order to get investment capital. The only variation one sees\nis a threshold on the number of shares held (some fi nite number\nversus “any”) for investors to continue to enjoy these rights.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nIf you care about information rights for your shareholders, you are nuts. You\nshould run a transparent organization as much as possible in the twenty-fi rst\ncentury. If you can’t commit to sending your shareholders a budget and fi nancial\nstatements, you shouldn’t take on outside investors. If you are of the paranoid\nmindset (which I generally applaud), feel free to insist on a strict confi dentiality\nclause to accompany your information rights.\nRegistration Rights\nRegistration rights defi ne the rights that investors have to registering\ntheir shares in an IPO scenario as well as the obligation of the com-\npany to the VCs whenever they fi le additional registration statements\nafter the IPO.

{"page": 109, "text": "Other Terms of the Term Sheet 91\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nDon’t focus much energy on registration rights. This is more about upside. The\nworld is good if you’re going public.\nRight of First Refusal\nThe right of fi rst refusal defi nes the rights that an investor has to buy\nshares in a future fi nancing. R ight of fi rst refusal is another chewy term\nthat takes up a lot of space in the term sheet but is hard for the entre-\npreneur to have much impact on. Following is the typical language:\nRight of First Refusal: Prior to a Qualifi ed IPO, Major Investors\nshall have the right to purchase their pro rata portions (calculated\non a fully diluted basis) of any future issuances of equity securi-\nties by the Company (with overallotment rights in the event a\nMajor Investor does not purchase its full allocation), other than\n(i) shares or options to purchase shares issued to employees, con-\nsultants or directors as approved by the Board, (ii) shares issued\nfor consideration other than cash pursuant to a merger, consoli-\ndation, acquisition, or similar business combination approved by\nthe Board; (iii) shares issued pursuant to any equipment loan or\nleasing arrangement, real property leasing arrangement or debt\nfi nancing from a bank or similar fi nancial institution approved by\nthe Board; and (iv) other issuances approved by the Required Per-\ncentage of the outstanding Series A Preferred from time to time.\nThe right of fi rst refusal is also known as a p ro rata right. While\nalmost all VCs will insist on a right of fi rst refusal, there are two things\nto pay attention to in this term that can be negotiated. First, the share\nthreshold that defi nes a major investor can be defi ned. It’s often conve-\nnient, especially if you have a large number of small investors, not to\nhave to give this right to them. However, since in future rounds you are\ntypically interested in getting as much participation from your existing\ninvestors as you can, it’s not worth struggling with this too much.\nA more important thing to watch for is a multiple on the pur-\nchase rights (e.g., the “[X] times” listed). This is often referred to\nas a super pro rata right and is an excessive ask, especially early in the\nfi nancing life cycle of a company."}

The\nCommon Stock may be increased or decreased by the vote of\nholders of a majority of the Common Stock and Series A Pre-\nferred voting together on an as-if-converted basis, and without\na separate class vote. Each share of Series A Preferred shall\nhave a number of votes equal to the number of shares of Com-\nmon Stock then issuable upon conversion of such share of\nSeries A Preferred.\nMost of the time the voting rights clause is simply an FYI section,\nas all the important rights, such as the protective provisions, are con-\ntained in other sections.\nRestriction on Sales\nThe restriction on sales clause, also known as the right of fi rst refusal\non sales of common stock (or ROFR on common), defi nes the\nparameters associated with selling shares of stock when the company\nis a private company. Typical language follows:\nRestrictions on Sales: The Company’s Bylaws shall contain a\nright of fi rst refusal on all transfers of Common Stock, subject\nto normal exceptions. If the Company elects not to exercise its\nright, the Company shall assign its right to the Investors."}
{"page": 111, "text": "Other Terms of the Term Sheet 93\nHistorically, founders and management rarely argue against this,\nas it helps control the shareholder base of the company, which usu-\nally benefits all the existing shareholders (except possibly the ones\nwho want to bail out of their private stock). However, we’ve found\nthat the lawyers will often spend time arguing about how to imple-\nment this particular clause—specifically whether to include it in the\nbylaws or include it in each of the company’s option agreements,\nplans, and stock sales. We find it easier to include this clause in the\nbylaws since then it’s in one place and is hard to overlook.\nIn the early days of venture capital (say, until 2007) there was\na strong conventional wisdom that founders and management\nshouldn’t be able to sell their shares until the investors could sell their\nshares, through either an IPO or a sale of the company. As the time\nto liquidity for private companies stretched out and IPOs became less\ncommon, this philosophy shifted. Simultaneously, a healthy second-\nary market for founders and early employee shares appeared, fueled\nboth by the rapid rise in valuation of private companies such as Face-\nbook, Uber, Airbnb, and Twitter, along with the emergence of private\nsecondary markets such as Second Market and SharesPost. The result\nis a lot more sales of private stock to other investors (sometimes new\nones, sometimes the existing investors) along with more scrutiny and\ndiscussion around the ROFR on common construct.\nAfter being involved in several situations where this has come\ninto play, we feel more strongly than ever that an ROFR on common\nis a good thing for the company and should be supported by the\nfounders, management, and investors. Controlling the share owner-\nship in a private company is important, especially as the Securities\nand Exchange Commission (SEC) takes a closer look at various pri-\nvate shareholder rules—both regarding ownership and stock sales.\nThe ROFR on common gives the company the ability to at least\nknow what is going on and make decisions in the context of the\nvarious proposals.\nProprietary Information and Inventions Agreement\nEvery term sheet we’ve ever seen has a proprietary information and\ninventions agreement clause. The typical language follows:\nProprietary Information and Inventions Agreement: Each current\nand former officer, employee, and consultant of the Company"}
{"page": 112, "text": "94 Venture Deals\nshall enter into an acceptable proprietary information and inven-\ntions agreement.\nThis paragraph benefi ts both the company and investors and is\nsimply a mechanism that investors use to get the company to legally\nstand behind the representation that it owns its intellectual prop-\nerty (IP). Many pre–Series A companies have issues surrounding\nthis, especially if the company hasn’t had great legal representation\nprior to its fi rst venture round. We’ve also run into plenty of situ-\nations (including several of ours—oops!) in which companies are\nloose about this between fi nancings, and while a fi nancing is a good\ntime to clean this up, it’s often annoying to previously hired employ-\nees who are now told, “Hey—you need to sign this since we need\nit for the venture fi nancing.” It’s even more important in the sale\nof a company, as the buyer will always insist on clear ownership of\nthe IP. Our best advice here is that companies should build these\nagreements into their hiring process from the very beginning (with\nthe advice from a good law fi rm) so that there are never any issues\naround this, as VCs will always insist on this agreement.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nA proprietary information and inventions agreement clause is good for the com-\npany. You should have all employees, including founders, sign something like\nthis before you do an outside venture fi nancing. If someone on the team needs\na specifi c carve-out for work in progress that is unrelated to the business, you\nand your investors should be willing to grant it.\nCo-Sale Agreement\nMost investors will insist on a co-sale agreement, which states that if\na founder sells shares, the investors will have an opportunity to sell a\nproportional amount of their stock as well. Typical language follows:\nCo-Sale Agreement: The shares of the Company’s securities\nheld by the Founders shall be made subject to a co-sale agree-\nment (with certain reasonable exceptions) with the Investors\nsuch that the Founders may not sell, transfer, or exchange their\nstock unless each Investor has an opportunity to participate in"}
{"page": 113, "text": "Other Terms of the Term Sheet 95\nthe sale on a pro rata basis. This right of co-sale shall not apply\nto and shall terminate upon a Qualifi ed IPO.\nThe chance of keeping this provision out of a fi nancing is close\nto zero, so we don’t think it’s worth fi ghting it. Notice that this mat-\nters only while the company is private—if the company goes public,\nthis clause no longer applies.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nYour chances of eliminating the co-sale agreement clause may be zero, but\nthere’s no reason not to ask for a fl oor to it. If you or your cofounders want to sell\na small amount of stock to buy a house, why should a VC hold it up? A right of\nfi rst refusal on the purchase with a bona fi de outside offer’s valuation as the pur-\nchase price is one thing. An effective exclusion is something entirely different.\nFounders’ Activities\nAs you wind your way through a typical term sheet, you’ll often see,\nburied near the back, a short clause concerning founders’ activities.\nIt usually looks something like this:\nFounders’ Activities: Each of the Founders shall devote 100% of\nhis professional time to the Company. Any other professional\nactivities will require the approval of the Board of Directors.\nIt should be no surprise to a founder that your friendly neigh-\nborhood VC wants you to be spending 100% (actually 120%) of\nyour professional time and attention on your company. If this para-\ngraph sneaks its way into the term sheet, the VC either has recently\nbeen burned, is suspicious, or is concerned that one or more of the\nfounders may be working on something besides the company being\nfunded. Or in our case, we just put in it to see if anyone pushes back\non it. If someone does, it starts an interesting conversation.\nOf course, this is a classic no-win situation for a founder. If you\nare actually working on something else at the same time and don’t\ndisclose it, you are violating the terms of the agreement in addition\nto breaching trust before you get started. If you do disclose other\nactivities or push back on this clause (hence signaling that you are"}
{"page": 114, "text": "96 Venture Deals\nworking on something else), you’ll reinforce the concern that the\nVC has. So tread carefully here. Our recommendation, unless of\ncourse you are working on something else, is simply to agree to this.\nIn situations where we’ve worked with a founder who already\nhas other obligations or commitments, we’ve always appreciated her\nbeing up front with us early in the process. We’ve usually been able\nto work through these situations in a way that results in everyone\nbeing happy, and in the cases where we couldn’t get there, were glad\nthat the issue came up early so that we didn’t waste our time or the\nentrepreneur’s time.\nWhile there are situations where VCs get comfortable with entre-\npreneurs working on multiple companies simultaneously (usually\nwith very experienced entrepreneurs or in situations where the VC\nand the entrepreneur have worked together in the past), they are a\nrare exception, not the norm.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nIf you can’t agree to a founders’ activities clause, don’t look for professional\nVC fi nancing. Or you can negotiate a very specifi c carve-out, and expect other\nconsequences in your terms (e.g., vesting and IP rights).\nInitial Public Offering Shares Purchase\nOne of the terms that falls into the “nice problem to have” category is\nthe initial public offering shares purchase. The typical language follows:\nInitial Public Offering Shares Purchase: In the event that the\nCompany shall consummate a Qualifi ed IPO, the Company shall\nuse its best efforts to cause the managing underwriter or under-\nwriters of such IPO to offer to [investors] the right to purchase\nat least [5%] of any shares issued under a “friends and family”\nor “directed shares” program in connection with such Qualifi ed\nIPO. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all action taken pursuant\nto this Section shall be made in accordance with all federal and\nstate securities laws, including, without limitation, Rule 134 of the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended, and all applicable rules and\nregulations promulgated by the National Association of Securi-\nties Dealers, Inc. and other such self-regulating organizations."}
{"page": 115, "text": "Other Terms of the Term Sheet 97\nThis term blossomed in the late 1990s when anything that was\nVC funded was positioned as a company that would shortly go pub-\nlic. However, most investment bankers will push back on this term\nif the IPO is going to be a success, as they want to get stock into\nthe hands of institutional investors (their clients). If the VCs get this\npush-back, they are usually so giddy with joy that the company is\ngoing public that they don’t argue with the bankers. Ironically, if\nthey don’t get this push-back, or even worse, get a call near the end\nof the IPO road show in which the bankers are asking them to buy\nshares in the offering, they usually panic and do whatever they can\nto not have to buy into the offering since this means the deal is no\nlonger a hot one.\nOur recommendation on this one is don’t worry about it or\nspend lawyer time on it.\nNo-Shop Agreement\nAs an entrepreneur, the way to get the best deal for a round of financ-\ning is to have multiple options. However, there comes a point in time\nwhen you have to choose your investor and shift from “search for an\ninvestor” mode to “close the deal” mode. Part of this involves choos-\ning your lead investor and negotiating the final term sheet with him.\nA no-shop agreement is almost always part of this final term\nsheet. Think of it as serial monogamy—your new investor-to-be\ndoesn’t want you running around behind his back just as you are\nabout to get hitched. A typical no-shop agreement follows:\nNo-Shop Agreement: The Company agrees to work in good faith\nexpeditiously toward a closing. The Company and the Founders\nagree that they will not, directly or indirectly, (i) take any action\nto solicit, initiate, encourage, or assist the submission of any pro-\nposal, negotiation, or offer from any person or entity other than\nthe Investors relating to the sale or issuance of any of the capital\nstock of the Company or the acquisition, sale, lease, license, or\nother disposition of the Company or any material part of the\nstock or assets of the Company, or (ii) enter into any discussions\nor negotiations or execute any agreement related to any of the\nforegoing, and shall notify the Investors promptly of any inquir-\nies by any third parties in regard to the foregoing. Should both\nparties agree that definitive documents shall not be executed"}
{"page": 116, "text": "98 Venture Deals\npursuant to this term sheet, then the Company shall have no\nfurther obligations under this section.\nAt some level the no-shop agreement, like serial monogamy,\nis more of an emotional commitment than a legal one. While it’s\nvery hard, but not impossible, to enforce a no-shop agreement in a\nfinancing, if you get caught cheating, your financing will probably\ngo the same way as the analogous situation when the groom or the\nbride-to-be gets caught in a compromising situation.\nThe no-shop agreement reinforces the handshake that says,\n“Okay, let’s get a deal done—no more fooling around looking for a\nbetter or different one.” In all cases, the entrepreneur should bound\nthe no-shop agreement by a time period—usually 45 to 60 days is\nplenty, although you can occasionally get a VC to agree to a 30-day\nno-shop agreement. This makes the commitment bidirectional—you\nagree not to shop the deal; the VC agrees to get things done within\na reasonable time frame.\nNow, some entrepreneurs still view that as a unilateral agreement;\nnamely, the entrepreneur is agreeing to the no-shop but the VC isn’t\nreally agreeing to anything at all. In most cases, we don’t view the no-\nshop clause as terribly important since it can be bounded with time.\nInstead, we feel it’s much more important for the entrepreneur to\ntest the VCs commitment to follow through on the investment when\nsigning up to do the deal.\nSpecifically, in some cases VCs put down term sheets early, well\nbefore they’ve got internal agreement within their partnership to\ndo an investment. This used to be more common; today many early-\nstage VCs don’t want to go through the hassle of drafting the term\nsheet and trying to negotiate it unless they believe they will do the\ndeal. In addition, there is a potential negative reputational impact\nfor the VC, as word will get around that VC X puts term sheets out\nearly, but then can’t or won’t close. In the age of the Internet, this\ntype of reputation spreads like an infectious disease.\nAlthough we’ve done hundreds of investments, we’ve only seen\na few situations where the no-shop agreement had any meaning-\nful impact on a deal in which we were involved. When we thought\nabout the situations in which we were the VC and were negatively\nimpacted by not having a no-shop agreement (e.g., a company we\nhad agreed with on a term sheet went and did something else) or\nwhere we were on the receiving end of a no-shop agreement and"}
{"page": 117, "text": "Other Terms of the Term Sheet 99\nwere negatively impacted by it (e.g., an acquirer tied us up but then\nultimately didn’t close on the deal), we actually didn’t feel particu-\nlarly bad about any of the situations since there was both logic asso-\nciated with the outcome and grace exhibited by the participants.\nFollowing are two examples:\nWe signed a term sheet to invest in Company X. We didn’t\ninclude a no-shop clause in the term sheet. We were working to\nclose the investment (we were 15 days into a 30-ish-day process) and\nhad legal documents going back and forth. One of the founders\ncalled us and said that they had just received an offer to be acquired\nand they wanted to pursue it. We told them no problem—we’d still\nbe there to do the deal if it didn’t come together. We were very\nopen with them about the pros and cons of doing the deal from our\nperspective and, given the economics, encouraged them to pursue\nthe acquisition offer (it was a great deal for them). They ended up\nclosing the deal and, as a token, gave us a small amount of equity\nin the company for our efforts (totally unexpected and unnecessary\nbut appreciated).\nIn another situation we were already investors in a company that\nwas in the process of closing an outside-led round at a significant\nstep-up in valuation. The company was under a no-shop agreement\nwith the new VC. A week prior to closing, we received an acquisi-\ntion overture from one of the strategic investors in the company.\nWe immediately told the new lead investor about it, who graciously\nagreed to suspend the no-shop agreement and wait to see whether\nwe wanted to move forward with the acquisition or with the financ-\ning. We negotiated with the acquirer for several weeks, checking\nregularly with the new potential investor to make sure they were\nstill interested in closing the round if we chose not to pursue the\nacquisition. They were incredibly supportive and patient. The com-\npany covered its legal fees up to that point (unprompted—although\nit was probably in the term sheet that we’d cover them; we can’t\nrecall). We ended up moving forward with the acquisition; the new\ninvestor was disappointed in the outcome but happy and supportive\nof what we did.\nWhile both of these are edge cases, in almost all of our experi-\nences the no-shop agreement ended up being irrelevant. As each of\nthese examples shows, the quality and the character of the people\ninvolved made all the difference and were much more important\nthan the legal term."}
{"page": 118, "text": "100 Venture Deals\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nAs an entrepreneur, you should also ask that the no-shop clause expire imme-\ndiately if the VC terminates the process. Also, consider asking for a carve-\nout for acquisitions. Frequently fi nancings and acquisitions follow each other\naround. Even if you’re not looking to be acquired, you don’t want handcuffs on\nconversations about an acquisition just because a VC is negotiating with you\nabout a fi nancing.\nIndemnifi cation\nThe indemnifi cation clause states that the company will indemnify\ninvestors and board members to the maximum extent possible by law.\nIt is another one that entrepreneurs just have to live with. It follows:\nIndemnifi cation: The bylaws and/or other charter documents\nof the Company shall limit board members’ liability and expo-\nsure to damages to the broadest extent permitted by applica-\nble law. The Company will indemnify board members and will\nindemnify each Investor for any claims brought against the\nInvestors by any third party (including any other shareholder of\nthe Company) as a result of this fi nancing.\nGiven all of the shareholder litigation in recent years, there is\nalmost no chance that a company will get funded without indemnify-\ning its directors. The fi rst sentence is simply a contractual obligation\nbetween the company and its board. The second sentence, which\nis occasionally negotiable, indicates the desire for the company to\npurchase formal liability insurance. One can usually negotiate away\ninsurance in a Series A deal, but for any follow-on fi nancing the\nmajor practice today is to procure directors’ and offi cers’ (D&O)\ninsurance. We believe companies should be willing to indemnify\ntheir directors and will likely need to purchase D&O insurance in\norder to attract outside board members.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nYou should have reasonable and customary D&O insurance for yourself as much\nas for your VCs. While the indemnifi cation clause is good corporate hygiene,\nmake sure you follow it up with an appropriate insurance policy."}

A term sheet will almost always contain a summary\ncap table, which we describe in this chapter. You, your prospective\ninvestors, or occasionally your lawyers will generate a more detailed\ncap table.\nThe cap table summarizes who owns what part of the company\nbefore and after the financing. This is one area that some founders,\nespecially those who have not been exposed in the past to cap table\nmath, are often uncomfortable with. It’s extremely important for\nfounders to understand exactly who owns what part of a company\nand what the implications are in a potential funding round.\nNormally when you initially set up the company, 100% will be\nallocated to the founders and employees, with a specific number of\nshares allocated to each individual. The question “What will I own\nif a venture capitalist invests X in my company at a Y valuation?” is\nrarely simple. To answer it, you need to be able to generate a cap\ntable to truly analyze the deal presented by a particular term sheet.\nFollowing is a model to work from with a typical example.\nLet’s assume the following:\n2 million shares held by founders before the VC invests\n$10 million pre-money valuation\n$5 million investment by the VC\n103"}
{"page": 121, "text": "104 Venture Deals\nIn this example, the post-money valuation is $15 million ($10 mil-\nlion pre-money + $5 million investment). Consequently, the VCs\nown 33.33% of the company after the financing ($5 million invest-\nment/$15 million post-money valuation). This should be pretty\nstraightforward so far.\nNow, assume the term sheet includes a new employee option\npool of 20% on a post-money basis. Remember that this means that\nafter the financing, there will be an unallocated option pool equal\nto 20% of the company.\nAlthough the post-money valuation remains the same ($15 mil-\nlion), the requirement for a 20% option pool will have a significant\nimpact on the ownership of the founders. Per the cap table, you\ncan see how we calculate the percentage ownership for each class\nof owner, along with the price per share of the preferred stock. To\nstart, we’ve filled in the known numbers and now have to solve for\nthe unknowns (A, B, C, D, and E).\nFirst, let’s solve for A, the founders’ ownership percentage: A =\n100% minus the VC percentage minus the employee pool percent-\nage, or 100% – 33.33% – 20% = 46.67%. Given that we know that the\n2 million founders’ shares represent 46.67% of the company, we can\ndetermine that the total shares outstanding (E = 2 million/0.4667)\nare 4,285,408. Now, if there are 4,285,408 shares outstanding, deter-\nmining the number of shares in the employee pool becomes B = E\n∗0.20 or 857,081.\nThe same math applies for C, the number of shares of preferred\nstock the VCs have. C = E ∗ 0.3333 or 1,428,326. Since $5 million\nbought 1,428,326 shares of preferred stock, then the price per share\nof preferred stock (D = $5 million/1,428,326) is $3.50 per share.\nFinally, always check your calculation. Since we know we have a\n$10 million pre-money valuation, then the shares prior to the financ-\ning (2 million founders’ shares plus the 20% option pool) times the\nprice per share should equal $10 million. If you do this math, you’ll\nExample Capitalization Table\nClass Shares Preferred Price Valuation Percentage\nFounders 2,000,000 A\nEmployee pool B 20%\nVenture investors C D $5,000,000 33.33%\nTotal E D $15,000,000 100%"}
{"page": 122, "text": "The Capitalization Table 105\nsee that (2 million + 857,081) * $3.50 = $9,999,783.50. Oops, we are\noff by $216.50, which represents 62 shares (well, 61.857 shares).\nWhile this is close enough for an example, it’s not close enough\nfor most VCs, or for most lawyers for that matter. And it shouldn’t\nbe close enough for you. That’s why most cap tables have two addi-\ntional signifi cant digits (or fractional shares)—the rounding to the\nnearest share doesn’t happen during intermediate steps but only at\nthe very end.\nAs the entrepreneur, you shouldn’t blindly rely on legal counsel\nto generate these documents. There are a lot of good lawyers out\nthere with poor math skills, and the cap table can get messed up\nwhen left in the hands of the lawyers. Although some get it right, it’s\nyour responsibility as the entrepreneur to make sure you understand\nyour cap table. This will be especially helpful at times when you want\nto expand the employee option pool and you are eloquent in front\nof your board of directors explaining the ramifi cations.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nIf you do not have a great fi nancially oriented founder, fi nd someone who\nknows what she’s doing to help you with the cap table—not just someone who\nknows math (a good starting point!), but someone who knows cap tables and\nVC fi nancings."}

However, there is one\nother type of financing, often used at the seed stage, called a con-\nvertible debt financing. In fact, many angel investors will invest only\nwith this structure.\nConvertible debt is just that: debt. It’s a loan. The loan will con-\nvert to equity (preferred stock, usually) at such time as another\nround is raised. The conversion usually includes some sort of dis-\ncount on the price to the future round.\nFor example, assume you raise $500,000 in convertible debt\nfrom angels with a 20% discount to the next round, and six months\nlater a venture capitalist (VC) offers to lead a Series A round of a\n$1 million investment at $1 a share. Your financing will actually be\nfor $1.5 million total, although the VCs will get 1 million Series A\nshares ($1 million at $1 per share) and the angels will get 625,000\nSeries A shares ($500,000 at $0.80 per share). The discount is appro-\npriate, as your early investors want some reward for investing before\nthe full Series A financing round comes together.\nIn this chapter, we cover the arguments for and against using\nconvertible debt. We then go through the terms in a convertible\ndebt deal, including the discount, valuation caps, interest rate, con-\nversion mechanics, conversion in a sale of the company, warrants,\nand other terms. We briefly cover the differences between early-stage\nand late-stage dynamics and finish up with an example of when con-\nvertible debt could be dangerous to use.\n107"}
{"page": 124, "text": "108 Venture Deals\nArguments For and Against Convertible Debt\nMost fans of convertible debt argue that it’s a much easier transaction\nto complete than an equity financing. Since no valuation is being\nset for the company, you get to avoid that part of the negotiation.\nBecause it is debt, it has few, if any, of the rights of preferred stock\nofferings and you can accomplish a transaction with a lot less paper-\nwork and legal fees. Note, however, that the legal fees argument is\nless persuasive these days with the many forms of standardized docu-\nments. A decade ago there could be a $50,000 pricing difference for\nlegal fees between a seed preferred round and a convertible debt\nround. These days the difference is less than $10,000 since many\nlawyers will heavily discount the seed preferred round to get future\nbusiness from the company.\nThe debate goes on endlessly about which structure is better or\nworse for entrepreneurs or investors. We aren’t convinced there is\na definitive answer here; in fact, we are convinced that those who\nthink there is a definitive answer are wrong.\nSince investors usually drive the decision about whether to raise\nan equity or a debt round, let’s look at their motivations first. One\nof the primary reasons for an early-stage investor to purchase equity\nis to price the stock being sold in the round. Early-stage investing\nis a risky proposition, and investors will want to invest at low prices,\nalthough smart investors won’t invest at a price at which founders\nare demotivated. As a result, most early-stage deals get priced in a\npretty tight range.\nWith a convertible debt structure, the stock price is not set and is\ndetermined at a later date when a larger financing occurs. By defini-\ntion, if there is a later round the company must be doing something\nright. Having a discount is nice, but the ultimate price for the early\nconvertible debt investors may still be higher than what they would\nhave paid if they had bought equity in the first place. Some investors\ntry to fix this problem by setting a cap on the price they will pay in\nthe next round. In other words, as an investor, I’ll take a 20% dis-\ncount on the price of the next round up to a valuation of $X. If you\nget a valuation above $X, then my valuation is $X (hence the notion\nof a valuation cap).\nThis sounds like it fixes the problem, right? This might for the\noriginal investor, but it might not for the company and the founders.\nFirst of all, the investors coming into the next round may not like the"}
{"page": 125, "text": "Convertible Debt 109\nidea that they are paying that much more than the convertible debt\ninvestors paid. Unlike equity, which is issued and can’t be changed,\nthe new equity investors could refuse to fund unless the debt inves-\ntors remove or change the cap. Keep in mind that VCs will normally\nfocus and peg their valuation of your company on that cap. You are\nessentially drawing a line in the sand (albeit a small one and in some\ncases it doesn’t actually affect the ultimate valuation) of what your\ncompany is worth in the future.\nFrom the entrepreneur’s standpoint, the choice isn’t clear,\neither. Some argue that the convertible debt structure, by definition,\nleads to a higher ultimate price for the first round. We won’t go as\nfar as to say they are right, but we can see the argument that with a\nconvertible debt feature you are allowing an inflated price based on\ntime to positively impact the valuation for the past investors. We’d\nargue that this is missing half of the analysis in that a founder’s first\ninvestors are sometimes the most important. These are the people\nwho invested in you at the riskiest stage before anyone else would.\nYou like them, you respect them, and you might even be related to\nthem. Assume that you create a lot of value along the way and the\nequity investor prices the round at a number that is higher than even\nyou expected. Your first investors will own less than anyone antici-\npated. At the end of the day, your biggest fans are happy about the\nfinancing, but sad that they own so little.\nBut does it really set a higher price? Let’s go back to the example\nof a convertible debt round with a cap. If we were going to agree to\nthis deal, our cap would be the price that we would have agreed to\nin an equity round. So, in effect, you’ve just sold the same amount\nof equity to us, but we have an option for the price to be lower than\nwe would have offered you since there are plenty of scenarios in\nwhich the equity price is below the cap amount. Why on earth would\nI agree to a cap that is above the price that I’m willing to pay today?\nThe cap amounts to a ceiling on your price. VCs will focus on that\ncap as well. There are plenty of situations where the VCs would have\nbeen willing to pay $X per share, but after seeing the cap number in\ndue diligence prior to a term sheet they offer only $Y (less than $X)\nper share because it’s within the cap. So while you may have gotten\na better deal on your seed round, your Series A round (which nor-\nmally sees the company raising a lot more money than a seed round)\nis now underpriced compared to what it could be. In the aggregate,\nthe company actually underpriced itself in this scenario."}
{"page": 126, "text": "110 Venture Deals\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nTo attract seed-stage investors, consider a convertible debt deal with two addi-\ntional features: a reasonable time horizon on an equity fi nancing and a forced\nconversion if that horizon isn’t met, as well as a fl oor, not a ceiling, on the con-\nversion valuation.\nThere’s also some dissonance here since VCs spend a lot of their\ntime valuing companies and negotiating on price. If your VC can’t or\nwon’t do this, what is this telling you? Do you and the VC have radi-\ncally different views of the value proposition you’ve created? Will this\nimpact the relationship going forward or the way that each of you\nstrategically thinks about your company?\nThe Discount\nRemember that a convertible debt deal doesn’t purchase equity in\nyour company. Instead, it’s simply a loan that has the ability to con-\nvert to equity based on some future fi nancing event. Let’s begin our\ndiscussion of terms for convertible debt with the most important\none, the discount .\nUntil recently, we had never seen a convertible debt deal that\ndidn’t convert at a discount to the next fi nancing round. Given some\nof the current excited market conditions at the seed stage, we’ve\nheard of convertible deals with no discount but view this as irregular\nand not sustainable over the long term.\nThe idea behind the discount is that investors should get, or\nrequire, more upside than just the interest rate associated with\nthe debt for the risk that they are taking by investing early. These\ninvestors aren’t banks—they are planning to own equity in the\ncompany, but are simply deferring the price discussion to the next\nfi nancing.\nSo how does the discount work? There are two approaches: the\ndiscounted price to the next round and warrants. We’ll cover the\ndiscounted price approach in this section, as it’s much simpler and\nbetter oriented for a seed round investment.\nFor the discounted price to the next round, you might see some-\nthing like this in the legal documents:"}
{"page": 127, "text": "Convertible Debt 111\nThis Note shall automatically convert in whole without any\nfurther action by the Holders into such Equity Securities at a\nconversion price equal to eighty percent (80%) of the price per\nshare paid by the Investors purchasing the Equity Securities on\nthe same terms and conditions as given to the Investors.\nThis means that if your next round investors are paying $1 per\nshare, then the note will convert into the same shares at a 20%\ndiscount, or $0.80 per share. For example, if you have a $100,000\nconvertible note, it will purchase 125,000 shares ($100,000 / $0.80)\nwhereas the new equity investor will get 100,000 shares for his invest-\nment of $100,000 ($100,000 / $1).\nThe range of discounts we typically see is 10 to 30%, with 20%\nbeing the most common. While occasionally you’ll see a discount\nthat increases over time (e.g., 10% if the round closes in 90 days,\n20% if it takes longer), we generally recommend entrepreneurs\n(and investors) keep this simple—it is the seed round, after all.\nValuation Caps\nThe next economic term is the valuation cap, also known as the cap.\nThe cap is an investor-favorable term that puts a ceiling on the con-\nversion price of the debt. The valuation cap is typically seen in seed\nrounds where the investors are concerned that the next round of\nfinancing will be at a price that is at a valuation that wouldn’t reward\nthem appropriately for taking a risk by investing early in the seed\nround.\nFor example, an investor wants to invest $100,000 in a company\nand thinks that the pre-money valuation of the company is some-\nwhere in the $2 million to $4 million range. The entrepreneur\nthinks the valuation should be higher. Either way, the investor and\nthe entrepreneur agree to not deal with a valuation negotiation and\ninstead decide to consummate a convertible debt deal with a 20%\ndiscount to the next round.\nNine months pass and the company is doing well. The entrepre-\nneur is happy and the investor is happy. The company goes to raise a\nround of financing in the form of preferred stock. It receives a term\nsheet at a $20 million pre-money valuation. In this case, the discount\nof 20% would result in the investor having an effective valuation of\n$16 million for his investment nine months ago."}
{"page": 128, "text": "112 Venture Deals\nOn one hand, the investor is happy for the entrepreneur; but on\nthe other hand, he is shocked by the relatively high valuation for his\ninvestment. He realizes he made a bad decision by not pricing the\ndeal initially, as anything below $16 million would have been better\nfor him. Of course, this is nowhere near the $2 million to $4 million\nthe investor was contemplating the company was worth at the time\nhe made the convertible debt investment.\nThe valuation cap addresses this situation. By agreeing on a cap,\nthe entrepreneur and the investor can still defer the price discussion\nbut set a ceiling at which point the conversion price caps.\nIn our previous example, let’s assume that the entrepreneur and\nthe investor agree on a $4 million cap. Since the deal has a 20%\ndiscount, any valuation up to $5 million will result in the investor\ngetting a discount of 20%. Once the discounted value goes above\nthe cap, then the cap will apply. So, in the case of the $20 million\npre-money valuation, the investor will get shares at an effective price\nof $4 million.\nAs we’ve mentioned, in some cases, caps can impact the valua-\ntion of the next round. Some VCs will look at the cap and view it as\na price ceiling to the next round price, assuming that it was the high\npoint negotiated between the seed investors and the entrepreneur.\nTo mitigate this, entrepreneurs should try not to disclose the seed\nround terms until a price has been agreed to with a new VC investor.\nLately, we’ve been seeing a lot of VCs ask for the terms of the con-\nvertible debt round before they are willing to issue a term sheet. We\nunderstand that it is hard for an entrepreneur to say no to a poten-\ntial funding partner’s requests.\nClearly, entrepreneurs would prefer not to have valuation caps.\nHowever, many seed investors recognize that an uncapped note has\nthe potential to create a big risk/return disparity, especially in frothy\nmarkets for early-stage deals. We believe that—over the long term—\ncaps create more alignment between entrepreneurs and seed inves-\ntors as long as the price cap is thoughtfully negotiated based on the\nstage of the company.\nInterest Rate\nSince convertible debt is a loan, it almost always has an interest rate\nassociated with it, as that’s the minimum upside an investor is going\nto want to have for the investment."}
{"page": 129, "text": "Convertible Debt 113\nWe believe interest rates on convertible debt should be as low\nas possible. This isn’t bank debt, and the investors are being fairly\ncompensated through the use of whatever type of discount has been\nnegotiated. If you are an entrepreneur, check out what the appli-\ncable federal rates (AFRs) are to see the lowest legally allowable interest\nrates; bump them up just a little bit (for volatility), and suggest what-\never that number is.\nRealizing that the discount and the interest rate are often\nlinked, we’ll usually see an interest rate between 4% and 12% (the\nmedian is 8%) associated with a discount between 10% and 30%\n(the median is 20%).\nConversion Mechanics\nEventually the convertible debt will convert into equity. There are\nseveral nuances around how and when the note will convert. These\nconversion mechanics are important but can usually be configured in a\nway where everyone will be happy with them if they concentrate on\ndefining them up front.\nIn general, debt holders have traditionally enjoyed superior\ncontrol rights over companies and the ability to force nasty things\nlike bankruptcy and involuntary liquidations. Therefore, hav-\ning outstanding debt (that doesn’t convert) can be a bad thing\nif an entrepreneur ever gets sideways with one of the debt hold-\ners. While it’s not talked about that much, it happens, and we’ve\nseen situations where the debt holder has excessive power in a\nnegotiation.\nHere is typical conversion language:\nIn the event that Payor issues and sells shares of its Equity Securi-\nties to investors (the “Investors”) on or before [180] days from\nthe date herewith (the “Maturity Date”) in an equity financ-\ning with total proceeds to the Payor of not less than $1 million\n(excluding the conversion of the Notes or other debt) (a “Quali-\nfied Financing”), then the outstanding principal balance of this\nNote shall automatically convert in whole without any further\naction by the Holders into such Equity Securities at a conversion\nprice equal to the price per share paid by the Investors purchas-\ning the Equity Securities on the same terms and conditions as\ngiven to the Investors."}
{"page": 130, "text": "114 Venture Deals\nLet’s take a look at what matters in this paragraph. Notice that\nin order for the note to convert automatically, all of the conditions\nmust be met. If not, there is no automatic conversion.\nTerm. Here, the company must sell equity within six months\n●\n(180 days) for the debt to automatically convert. Consider\nwhether this is enough time. If we were entrepreneurs, we’d\ntry to get this period to be as long as possible. Many venture\nfirms are not allowed (by their agreements with their inves-\ntors) to issue debt that has a maturity date longer than a year,\nso don’t be surprised if one year is the maximum that you can\nnegotiate if you are dealing with a VC investor.\nAmount. In this case the company must raise $1,000,000 of new\n●\nmoney for the debt to convert because the conversion of the\noutstanding debt is excluded. The entrepreneur often gets\nto decide the amount based on the minimum the company\nis hoping to raise. When you determine this number, think\nabout how long you have (180 days in this example) and how\nmuch you think you can reasonably raise in that time period.\nSo what happens if the company does not achieve the milestones\nto automatically convert the debt? The debt stays outstanding unless\nthe debt holders agree to convert their holdings. This is when vot-\ning control comes into play. It is important to pay attention to the\namendment provision in the notes.\nAny term of this Note may be amended or waived with the writ-\nten consent of Payor and the Majority Holders. Upon the effec-\ntuation of such waiver or amendment in conformance with this\nSection 11, the Payor shall promptly give written notice thereof\nto the record Holders of the Notes who have not previously con-\nsented thereto in writing.\nWhile one will never see anything less than a majority of holders\nneeding to consent to an amendment (and thus a different standard\nfor conversion), make sure the standard doesn’t get too high. For\ninstance, if you had two parties splitting $1 million in convertible\ndebt with a 60/40 percentage split, you only need one party to con-\nsent if the majority rules, but both parties would need to consent if\na supermajority must approve.

There are a few different scenarios.\nThe investor gets its money back plus interest. If there is no specific\nlanguage addressing this situation, this is what usually ends up hap-\npening. In this case, the convertible debt document doesn’t allow\nthe debt to convert into anything, but at the same time mandates\nthat upon a sale the debt must be paid off. So the investors don’t see\nany of the upside on the acquisition. The potentially bad news is that\nif the merger is an all-stock deal, the company will need to find a way\nto find cash to pay back the loan or negotiate a way for the acquiring\ncompany to deal with the debt.\nThe investor gets its money back, plus interest plus a multiple of the orig-\ninal principal amount. In this case, the documents dictate that the\ncompany will pay back outstanding principal plus interest and then\na multiple on the original investment. Usually we see a multiple of\ntwo to three times, but in later-stage companies this multiple can be\neven higher. Typical language follows:\nSale of the Company: If a Qualified Financing has not occurred\nand the Company elects to consummate a sale of the Company\nprior to the Maturity Date, then notwithstanding any provision\nof the Notes to the contrary (i) the Company will give the Inves-\ntors at least five days prior written notice of the anticipated clos-\ning date of such sale of the Company and (ii) the Company will\npay the holder of each Note an aggregate amount equal to ___\ntimes the aggregate amount of principal and interest then out-\nstanding under such Note in full satisfaction of the Company’s\nobligations under such Note.\nSome sort of conversion does occur. In the case of an early-stage com-\npany that hasn’t issued preferred stock yet, the debt converts into\nstock of the acquiring company (if it’s a stock deal) at a valuation\nsubject to a cap. If it’s not a stock deal, then one normally sees one\nof the preceding scenarios."}
{"page": 132, "text": "116 Venture Deals\nWith later-stage companies, the investors usually structure the\nconvertible notes to have the most flexibility. They either get a mul-\ntiple payout on the debt or get the equity upside based on the pre-\nvious preferred round price. Note that if the acquisition price is\nlow, the holders of the debt may usually opt out of conversion and\ndemand cash payment on the notes.\nWhile in many cases issuing convertible debt is easier to deal\nwith than issuing equity, the one situation where this often becomes\ncomplex is an acquisition while the debt is outstanding. Our strong\nadvice is to address in the documents how the debt will be handled\nin an acquisition.\nWarrants\nA few sections ago we discussed the “discounted price to the next\nround” approach to providing a discount on convertible debt. The\nother approach to a discount is to issue warrants. This approach\nis more complex and usually applies only to situations where the\ncompany has already raised a round of equity, but it occasionally\npops up in early-stage deals. If you are doing a seed round, we\nencourage you not to use this approach and instead save some\nlegal fees. However, if you are doing a later-stage convertible debt\nround or your investors insist on you issuing warrants, here’s how\nit works.\nAssume that once again the investor is investing $100,000 and\nreceives warrant coverage in the amount of 20% of the amount of\nthe convertible note. In this case the investor will get a warrant for\n$20,000.\nThis is where it can get a little tricky. What does $20,000 worth of\nwarrants mean? A warrant is an option to purchase a certain number\nof shares at a predetermined price. But how do you figure out the\nnumber of warrants and the price that the warrants will be at? There\nare numerous different ways to calculate this, such as:\n$20,000 worth of common stock at the last value ascribed to\n●\neither the common or the preferred stock.\n$20,000 worth of the last round of preferred stock at that\n●\nround’s price of the stock.\n$20,000 worth of the next round of preferred stock at what-\n●\never price that happens to be."}
{"page": 133, "text": "Convertible Debt 117\nAs you can see, the actual percentage of the company associated\nwith the warrants can vary greatly depending on the price of the\nsecurity that underlies it. As a bonus, the particular ownership of\ncertain classes may affect voting control of a particular class of stock.\nIf there is a standard, it’s the second version, where the war-\nrants are attached to the prior preferred stock round. If there is\nno prior preferred, then one normally sees the stock convert to the\nnext preferred round unless an acquisition of the company occurs\nbefore a preferred round is consummated; in that case, it reverts to\nthe common stock.\nFor example, assume that the round gets done at $1 per share\nas in the previous example. The investor who holds a $100,000 con-\nvertible note will get $20,000 of warrants, or 20,000 warrants at an\nexercise price of $1, to go along with the 100,000 shares received in\nthe financing from the conversion of the note.\nWarrants have a few extra terms that matter.\nTerm length. The length of time the warrants are exercisable,\n●\nwhich is typically 5 to 10 years. Shorter is better for the entre-\npreneur and company. Longer is better for the investor.\nMerger considerations. What happens to the warrants in the event\n●\nthe company is acquired? We can’t opine more strongly that\nall warrants should expire at a merger unless they are exer-\ncised just prior to the transaction. In other words, the warrant\nholder must decide to either exercise or give up the warrants\nif the company is acquired. Acquiring companies hate buying\ncompanies that have warrants that survive a merger and allow\nthe warrant holder to buy equity in the acquirer. Many merg-\ners have been held up because warrants with this feature have\nupset the potential acquirer and thus as part of the closing\nrequirements the acquirer has mandated that the company\ngo out and repurchase or edit the terms of the warrants. This\nis not a good negotiating spot for the company to find itself\nin, as it will have to pay off warrant holders while disclosing\nthe potential merger (so the company will have little leverage)\nand at the same time will have a sword hanging over its head\nby the acquirer until the issue is resolved.\nOriginal issue discount (OID). This is an accounting issue that\n●\nis boring, yet important. If a convertible debt deal includes\nwarrants, the warrants must be paid for separately in order to"}
{"page": 134, "text": "118 Venture Deals\navoid the OID issue. In other words, if the debt is for $100,000\nand there is 20% warrant coverage, the Internal Revenue\nService (IRS) says that the warrants themselves have some\nvalue. If there is no provision for the actual purchase of the\nwarrants, the investor will have received an original issue dis-\ncount, which says that the $100,000 debt was issued at a dis-\ncount since the investor also received warrants. The problem\nis that part of the $100,000 principal repaid will be included\nas interest to the investor or, even worse, it will be accrued as\nincome over the life of the note even before any payments are\nmade. The easy fix is to pay something for the warrants, which\nusually is an amount in the low thousands of dollars.\nThe difference between warrants and a discount is probably\ninsignificant for the investor. We suppose if the investor is able to\nget warrants for common stock, then perhaps the ultimate value of\nwarrants may outweigh the discount, but it’s not clear. As evidenced\nby the number of words we have devoted to the topic, warrants add\na fair amount of complexity and legal costs to the mix. However,\nsome discounts will include valuation caps, and that can create some\nnegative company valuation ramifications while warrants completely\nstay away from the valuation discussion. Warrants are not nearly as\npopular as they once were as discounts are more typically used.\nFinally, in no case should an entrepreneur let an investor double\ndip and receive both a discount and warrants. That’s not a reason-\nable position for investors to take—they should either get a discount\nor get warrants.\nOther Terms\nThere are a few other terms that can show up in a convertible debt\ndeal. You’ll recognize these from the earlier chapters on terms in\nan equity financing, as they are the terms that more sophisticated\nangels or seed investors will insist on to preserve their rights in later\nfinancings.\nThe first term you’ll occasionally see in a convertible debt financ-\ning is a pro rata right, which will allow debt holders to participate pro-\nratably in a future financing. Since the dollars invested in a convert-\nible debt deal are often small, investors may ask for super pro rata\nrights. For instance, if an investor invests $500,000 in a convertible"}
{"page": 135, "text": "Convertible Debt 119\ndebt deal and the company later raises $7 million, the investor’s pro\nrata investment rights wouldn’t allow the investor to purchase a large\nportion of the next round. As a result, the seed investor may ask for a\npro rata right for two to four times the investor’s current ownership\nor for a specific percentage (say 5% to 20%) of the next financing.\nWhile pro rata rights are pretty typical, if you have people asking for\nsuper pro rata rights or a specific portion of the next financing, you\nshould be careful, as granting these will limit your long-term financ-\ning options.\nEvery now and then you’ll see a liquidation preference in a con-\nvertible debt deal. It works the same way as in a preferred stock\ndeal: the investors get their money back first, or a multiple of their\nmoney back first, before any proceeds are distributed to anyone\nelse. This usually happens in the case when a company is struggling\nto raise capital and current investors offer a convertible debt (also\ncalled a bridge loan) deal to the company. Back in the good old\ndays, usury laws prevented such terms, but in most states this is not\nan issue and the investors are allowed to have not only the security\nof holding debt, but the upside of preferred stock should a liquida-\ntion event occur.\nEarly-Stage versus Late-Stage Dynamics\nTraditionally, convertible debt was issued by mid- to late-stage start-\nups that needed a financing to get them to a place where they\nbelieved they could raise more money. Thus, these deals were called\nbridge financings.\nThe terms were basically the same unless the company was per-\nforming poorly and there was doubt about the ability to raise new\ncapital, or the bridge was to get the company to an acquisition or\nan orderly shutdown. In these cases, one saw terms like liquidation\npreferences and in some cases changes to board or voting control\ncome into play. Some of these bridge loans also contained terms like\npay-to-play, which we discussed in Chapter 4.\nGiven the traditional complexity and cost of legal fees associated\nwith preferred stock financings, however, convertible debt became\na common way to make seed-stage investments, as it tended to be\nsimpler and less expensive from a legal perspective. Over time,\nequity rounds have become cheaper to consummate, and the legal\nfees argument doesn’t carry much weight these days. In the end, the"}

You’ll\nhave to forgive us, but Jason is an ex-lawyer and sometimes we can’t\nkeep him in his cage.\nIf a company raises cash via equity, it has a positive balance sheet.\nIt is solvent (assets are greater than obligations), and the board and\nexecutives have fiduciary duties to the shareholders in the efforts\nto maximize company value. The shareholders are all the usual sus-\npects: the employees and VCs. Life is good and normal.\nHowever, if a company is insolvent, the board and company may\n(based in large part on state law—ask your attorney) now owe fidu-\nciary duties to the creditors of the company. By definition, if you\nraise a convertible debt round, your company is insolvent. You have\ncash, but your debt obligations are greater than your assets. Your\ncreditors include your landlord, anyone you owe money to (includ-\ning former disgruntled employees), and founders who have lawyers.\nHow does this change the paradigm? To be fair, we have had no\npersonal war stories here, but it’s not hard to construct some weird\nsituations.\nLet’s look at the hypothetical situation.\nAssume the company is not a success and fails. In the case of\nraising equity, the officers and directors owe a duty only to the credi-\ntors (e.g., the landlord) at such time that cash isn’t large enough to\npay their liabilities. If the company manages it correctly, creditors\nare paid off cleanly even on the downside scenario. But sometimes\nit doesn’t happen this way and there are lawsuits. When the lawyers\nget involved, they’ll look to establish the time in which the company\nwent insolvent and then try to show that the actions of the board\nwere bad during that time. If the time frame is short, it’s hard to\nmake a case against the company.\nHowever, if you raise debt, the insolvency time lasts until your\ndebt converts into equity. As a result, if your company ends up fail-\ning and you can’t pay your creditors, the ability for a plaintiff lawyer\nto judge your actions has increased dramatically. And don’t forget:\nif you have any outstanding employment litigation, all of these folks\ncount as creditors as well."}
{"page": 137, "text": "Convertible Debt 121\nThe worst part of this is that many states impose personal liability\non directors for things that occur while a company is insolvent. This\nmeans that some states will allow creditors to sue directors personally\nfor not getting all of the money they are owed.\nNow, we don’t want to get too crazy here. We are talking about\nearly-stage and seed companies, and hopefully the situation is clean\nenough that these doomsday predictions won’t happen, but our bet\nis that few folks participating in convertible debt rounds are actually\nthinking about these issues. While we don’t know of any actual cases\nout there, we’ve been around this business long enough to know that\nthere is constant innovation in the plaintiff’s bar as well.\nAn Alternative to Convertible Debt\nOver the years, in addition to efforts to standardize early-stage financ-\ning documents, there have been several attempts to create a synthetic\nearly-stage financing instrument that combines the best characteris-\ntics of equity and debt. The most recent, and most popular instru-\nment was created several years ago by Y Combinator and is called the\nsafe (Simple Agreement for Future Equity). It was followed quickly\nby 500 Startups’ version called KISS (Keep It Simple Security), dem-\nonstrating once again that document standardization is not a reality\nin the world of startups, at least as long as lawyers are involved.\nThe idea of the safe (yes, the phrasing “the safe” is deliberate, as\nit’s intended to be analogous to “the note,” which is how convertible\nnotes are often referred to) is that the investor buys what effectively\nis an unpriced warrant in the company, as opposed to buying con-\nvertible debt. This eliminates some of the concerns around using\ndebt, including the edge case issues around legal dynamics of debt,\nand eliminates some features of debt such as interest.\nAs with convertible debt, the safe can have a cap and/or a dis-\ncount. An MFN, or most favored nation clause, can also be included so\nthat if better terms are given to future investors, they are automati-\ncally inherited by the safe investors.\nFor investors, the safe has several disadvantages over convertible\nnotes, such as the lack of an explicit pro-rata right in the following\nround. As with convertible notes, this can be added, but at some\nlevel this undermines the idea of a simple, standard document.\nThe lack of maturity date is both an advantage and a disadvan-\ntage.

In many convertible\ndebt situations, investors will simply extend the maturity date. How-\never, in some situations, especially ones where companies are strug-\ngling and the entrepreneurs are not communicating with the inves-\ntors, the lack of a maturity date takes away a key leverage point—at\nleast for a discussion—from the investors.\nAs with convertible debt, the safe punts on many of the key issues\n(the most important of these being valuation) that are addressed\nwith an equity round enabling both founders and investors to defer,\nor be lazy about, issues until the next financing round."}

Since\nthen, it has emerged as a powerful approach, both for product\ndevelopment and equity financing. In this chapter we will discuss\nthe various crowdfunding approaches and legal implications, and\nhow crowdfunding differs from more traditional methods.\nProduct Crowdfunding\nCrowdfunding typically refers to two different approaches that are\nrelevant to financing companies. The first, popularized by Kick-\nstarter and Indiegogo, is product crowdfunding.\nProduct crowdfunding is typically used for physical products. The\ncompany puts its product idea up on Kickstarter along with content\nshowing what the product will do and a series of different rewards\nfor backers. In most cases, the product is in an early design stage and\nfar from ready to ship. The rewards vary by dollar amount and often\ninclude things that, while linked to the product, are experiential or\ntangential to the product, such as logoed stickers and T-shirts, spon-\nsorship recognition, or real-world events to celebrate the launch of\nthe product.\nMost campaigns have a 30-day funding target that, if not achieved,\nresults in the campaign failing and funding not occurring. This is\nthe hardware equivalent of building a software minimum-viable product\n(MVP). If the campaign is successful, you know you have a compelling\n123"}

If the campaign does not reach its funding target, your poten-\ntial customers are telling you that your MVP is not interesting enough\nto pursue.\nSeveral high profile products got their start on Kickstarter,\nincluding the Pebble Watch (which raised $10.2 million in 30 days)\nand Oculus Rift (which raised $2.5 million in 30 days). Companies\nhave also had similar successes on Indiegogo, such as TrackR, which\nraised $1.7 million.\nIf this sounds similar to a preorder campaign, it is, and you will\nalso hear people refer to them as “presales” or “preorders.” While\nKickstarter, Indiegogo, and other crowdfunding sites are growing\nrapidly, some companies, such as Glowforge, have decided to run\ntheir own preorder campaigns. In Glowforge’s case, they raised\n$27.9 million in 30 days, demonstrating that if you have a compel-\nling product and are sophisticated around marketing and promoting\nyour product, you can run a very successful preorder campaign on\nyour own.\nThe crowdfunding approach can even be rolled into your busi-\nness model. When we invested in Betabrand, they were building\na two-sided clothing marketplace that incorporated the notion of\ncrowdfunding into their design process. Individual designers can\ncreate new designs that are then promoted on Betabrand’s website.\nCustomers preorder the designs and if a certain preorder threshold\nis met, the design is produced and becomes a permanent product in\nBetabrand’s catalog.\nIn each of these cases, one of the large advantages of this\napproach is that the funding is nondilutive as no equity is involved.\nInstead of selling equity or debt, you are preselling a product and\ncollecting the cash up front.\nThe downside of product crowdfunding is the situation where a\ncampaign is successful but the company doesn’t finish building the\nproduct. In some cases, the company is able to raise addition capital,\noften equity, to complete the product and fulfill the preorders. In\nothers, the company never ships the product or only fulfills some\naspect of the campaign. While this situation is disappointing, the\nculture around product crowdfunding is such that these failures\nare understood to be part of the process, in the same way that invest-\ning equity in a company does not necessarily result in a successful\ncompany and a return on the investment."}
{"page": 141, "text": "Crowdfunding 125\nEquity Crowdfunding\nThe second crowdfunding approach, popularized by AngelList, is\nequity crowdfunding. This approach pertains to the situation when\nan investor gives money to a company in exchange for a security\n(either debt or equity) through an intermediated process, often\ninvolving an online funding platform. These platforms, such as\nAngelList, allow companies to essentially advertise their funding or\nuse the power of a social network to attract other investor interest.\nEvolved approaches, such as AngelList Syndicates, allow individual\ninvestors to aggregate other investors to participate in their syndicate,\nacting like a small version of a venture capital fund.\nWhile crowdfunding has expanded to cover many different situ-\nations, there are tight legal definitions surrounding each approach\nthat were defined as part of the JOBS Act (the full name is the Jump-\nstart Our Business Startups Act) that was passed in 2012. As a result,\nsome of the aspects of fundraising on platforms like AngelList are\nreferred to as crowdfunding, but are really not anything new, other\nthan the use of an online platform to connect companies with poten-\ntial investors.\nIn the United States, if you are selling a security, you need to\nregister the security with the Securities and Exchange Commission\n(SEC) unless you have an exemption not to. A security is any finan-\ncial instrument that gives you an ownership interest in a company,\nincluding common stock, preferred stock, or convertible debt. This\ndoesn’t include revenue derived from product crowdfunding or a\npreorder campaign. The original rules for registering securities were\ndefined in the Securities Act of 1933, and, while they have evolved,\nare still based on rules negotiated more than 80 years ago.\nFortunately, there are a number of exemptions that allow you\nto avoid an SEC registration. In general, unless you are taking a\ncompany public via initial public offering (IPO), you won’t have to\nworry about registering your offering with the SEC. However, there\nare important guidelines that you must follow in order not to blow\nup your ability to rely on an exemption. The two most important to\nunderstand are the concept of an accredited investor and the process\nof general solicitation.\nAn accredited investor is a person who has a substantial net worth\nor income, as defined by the SEC and changed from time to time.\nIn most cases, entities such as a VC, a corporation with meaningful"}

An individual quali-\nfies if she earns $200,000 per year or has a joint income with her spouse\nof $300,000 and this level has been earned in the previous two years\nand can be reasonably expected to be earned in the future. If an indi-\nvidual doesn’t have this level of income, she can qualify if she has a net\nworth exceeding $1 million either alone or jointly with her spouse.\nUnlike an accredited investor, the SEC does not clearly define\nwhat is considered to be general solicitation, instead leaving it open\nto interpretation. Historically, general solicitation referred to adver-\ntising or publicly promoting your fundraising, such as specifically\nmaking a financing ask in public at an accelerator demo day. Depend-\ning on your lawyer and how conservative you are, the line of where\ngeneral solicitation is crossed is vague, but the simple test is that if\nyou don’t have a preexisting relationship with someone and encoun-\nter them through something that looks like an advertisement (which\ncould include a mass email, rather than a one-on-one introduction),\nthen you are likely in the general solicitation bucket.\nPrior to the JOBS Act, one wanted to avoid raising money from\ninvestors who were not accredited as well as avoid general solicitation.\nWith the JOBS Act, the rules changed somewhat.\nWhile there are an endless number of $99 courses on how to\nraise money for your company using crowdfunding, our friend Brad\nBernthal, a law professor at CU Boulder, created the following chart\nas a summary of the implications of the three major crowdfunding\nand financing aspects of the JOBS Act. These are known as Rule\n506(b), Rule 506(c)/Title II, and Title III.\nRule 506(b) Rule 506(c)/Title II Title III\nAggregate cap on No No Yes ($1 million over 12 months)\namount raised?\nGeneral solicitation No Yes No, except via a single funding\nallowed? portal or broker\nWho can invest?

{"page": 143, "text": "Crowdfunding 127\nthe JOBS Act, it was next to impossible to raise a meaningful amount\nof money from nonaccredited investors.\nFrom a legal perspective, equity crowdfunding is really only\nTitle III, where nonaccredited investors can participate. Not surpris-\ningly, this is also the most heavily regulated approach. A company is\nlimited to raising $1 million over a 12-month period and it can only\nsolicit through one online funding portal or with a broker. While\nnonaccredited investors can participate in a Title III financing, there\nare limits on the size of individual investments, which, depending on\nthe investor’s net worth, can be as little at $2,000. Finally, there is a\nsignificant burden of SEC-mandated information disclosures that can\neasily cost a company tens of thousands of dollars to comply with.\nEven though the phrase crowdfunding gets regularly applied\nto financings done on AngelList and other online platforms, this is\noften more around marketing the platform than it is around the sub-\nstance of investing. Most of the financings done on AngelList happen\nunder the 506(b) rules, which is similar to how most VC financings\nhave historically been done. In some cases, companies use 506(c) so\nthey can advertise more widely on a site like AngelList, but still only\naccept accredited investors. In these situations, there are additional\nregulations to ensure their investors are, indeed, accredited.\nHow Equity Crowdfunding Differs\nA difference between equity crowdfunding and a more traditional\nfinancing is that with crowdfunding you are often setting the terms\nof the deal. Most sites allow you to determine the form of security\nyou are issuing (equity versus debt) and to set all the major terms.\nWhile this is occasionally negotiated with a lead investor, in our expe-\nrience most companies do not see much pushback on the terms they\npropose as long as they are reasonable.\nWhile convertible debt financings are generally straightforward,\nthey typically include a specific cap. With equity financings, a very\nlight preferred stock with minimal protective provisions and terms\nare often used. Board seats, at least as part of the crowdfunding\nactivity, are rarely offered.\nThe materials you put together include a traditional executive\nsummary and a PowerPoint presentation. When raising online,\nyou often get opportunities to spice things up with a fancy video,"}

In crowdfunding situations, you are getting a crowd. While\nyou may have a lead investor, you will now have many small investors\nwho may, or may not, be focused on helping your company. Their\ninvestment may be a tiny dollar amount for them and they may have\nmany separate small investments. Consequently, the responsibility\non communication and engagement will be on you as it’s unlikely\nthat many of your new investors will proactively reach out to help.\nWhile this is similar to a situation where you raise money tradition-\nally from a bunch of individual angels, it’s a common dynamic in\ncrowdfunding deals.\nWe’ve observed some companies end up being stranded after a\ncrowdfunding round. These companies either can’t, or don’t, raise\nenough money in the crowdfunding round and find themselves\nwithout money and with a noncommitted investor syndicate. Often,\nthese companies are not mature enough to attract a VC financing\nand end up in a situation where they are too early for VCs, yet don’t\nhave meaningful support from their existing crowd of investors.\nFinally, watch out for the jerks. We’ve seen situations where\none or more members of a crowdfunded financing feel overly self-\nimportant, construct belief systems around the company that are\ndelusional, or simply regret investing and try to exert pressure on\nthe founders in inappropriate ways. While some angel investors for-\nget that they are supposed to be “angels” instead of “devils,” some\ncrowdfunding participants don’t appear to have subscribed to the\nangel notion to begin with. While some of this results from lack of\nsophistication of some investors in crowdfunding deals, there often\nis less concern about reputational constraints given the dynamics of\ncrowdfunding as compared to angel or VC investing. A final chal-\nlenge with crowdfunding platforms is that it’s more difficult for the\nentrepreneur to do detailed diligence on the crowd, so beware of\nthe squeaky wheel who can be a real pain in the neck."}

We’ve been asked\nmany times to divulge the deep, dark secrets of what makes VCs tick.\nOne night over dinner we talked through much of this with a very\nexperienced entrepreneur who was in the middle of a negotiation\nfor a late stage round for his company. At the end of the discus-\nsion, he implored us to put pen to paper since even though he was\nextremely experienced and had been involved in several VC-backed\ncompanies, our conversation helped him understand the nuances\nof what he was dealing with, which, until our explanation, had been\nconfusing him.\nIn general, it’s important to understand what drives your current\nand future business partners—namely, your VCs—as their motiva-\ntions will impact your business. While the basics of how a venture\nfund works may be known, in this chapter we try to also cover all the\nnonobvious issues that play into how VCs think and behave. To do\nthat, we’ll dive into how funds are set up and managed as well as the\npressures (both internally and externally) that VCs face.\nOverview of a Typical Structure\nLet’s start by describing a typical VC fund structure (see illustration).\nThere are three basic entities that make up the fund. The first entity\nis the management company and is usually owned by the senior partners.\nThe management company employs all of the people with whom you\n129"}
{"page": 146, "text": "130 Venture Deals\ninteract at the firm, such as the partners, associates, and support staff,\nand pays for all of the normal day-to-day business expenses such as the\nfirm’s office lease, fresh fruit juicer, and monthly Internet expense.\nAs a result, the management company is essentially the franchise\nof the firm. While old funds are retired and new funds are raised,\nthe management company lives on and services each of the funds\nthat are raised. A VC’s business card almost always lists the name of\nthe management company, which is one of the reasons that the sig-\nnature blocks on a term sheet often have a different name than the\none you are used to associating with the firm. For example, in our\ncase, Foundry Group is the name of our management company, not\nthat of the actual funds that we raise and invest from.\nThe next entity is the limited partnership (LP) vehicle. When a VC\ntalks about his “fund” or that his firm “raised a fund of $225 million,”\nhe is actually talking about a limited partnership vehicle that con-\ntains the investors in the fund (also called limited partners, or LPs).\nThe final entity is one an entrepreneur rarely hears of called the\ngeneral partnership (GP) entity. This is the legal entity for serving as\nthe actual general partner to the fund. In some partnerships, the\nindividual managing directors play this role, but over time this has\nevolved into a separate legal entity that the managing directors each\nown on a fund-by-fund basis.\nManagement Company\nI”\n“Fund PG ae rn tne era l PG ae rtn ne er ra Il “ F\nr I I u n\nd\nLLC LLC II”\nFund Fund\nI LP II LP\nLP1LP2LP 3 LP ...LPn (Investors) (Investors)LP1LP2LP 3 LP ...LPn\nManagement Company Structure: General Partnership and Limited Partnership"}
{"page": 147, "text": "How Venture Capital Funds Work 131\nWe realize this is confusing unless you are in law school, in which\ncase you are likely salivating with joy over the legal complexity we are\nexposing you to. The key point to remember is that there is sepa-\nration between the management company (the franchise) and the\nactual funds that it raises (the LP entities). These distinct entities will\noften have divergent interests and motivations, especially as manag-\ning directors join or leave the venture capital firm. One managing\ndirector may be your point of contact today, but this person may\nhave different alignments among his multiple organizations that will\npotentially affect you.\nHow Firms Raise Money\nThe next time you are on the fundraising trail beating your head\nagainst the wall trying to get through to a VC about how awesome\nyour business is, remember that VCs also get to enjoy the same pro-\ncess when raising funds. So, while we feel your pain, we also admit\nthat many VCs quickly forget about the whole process and inflict too\nmuch pain on the entrepreneurs raising money. While this know-\nledge might help a little when you are sitting frustrated in your hotel\nroom after another day of fundraising, we encourage you to also\ndiscover the magic soothing properties of scotch. (When Brad is\ndrinking, his current favorite is Lagavulin 16, while Jason has lately\nbeen enjoying Macallan 15.)\nVCs raise money from a variety of entities, including government\nand corporate pension funds, large corporations, banks, professional\ninstitutional investors, educational endowments, high-net-worth\nindividuals, funds of funds, charitable organizations, and insurance\ncompanies. The arrangement between the VCs and their investors\nis subject to a long, complicated contract known as the limited part-\nnership agreement (LPA) that makes one thing clear: VCs have bosses\nalso—their investors, also known as their LPs.\nWhen a VC firm makes an announcement that it has raised a\n$100 million fund, it is not the case that the VC has $100 million\nsitting in the bank waiting for a smart entrepreneur to come along.\nThe venture capital firm normally keeps very little cash on hand and\nmust ask its LPs every time it wants money to make an investment.\nThis is known as a capital call and it typically takes two weeks from\nthe moment the money is requested until it arrives. Note that the\nLPs are legally obligated under the fund agreements to send the VCs\nmoney every time they make a capital call."}
{"page": 148, "text": "132 Venture Deals\nIf a venture capital firm requests money and its investors say no,\nthings get tricky. The VC usually has some very draconian rights in\nthe LPA to enforce its capital call, but we’ve seen several moments\nin history when VCs have done a capital call and there has been a\nsmaller amount of money to be had than anticipated. This is not\na good thing if you are the entrepreneur relying on getting a deal\ndone with the VC. Fortunately, this is a rare occurrence.\nWhy might investors refuse to fund a capital call? For one, LPs\nmay think the VC is making bad decisions and may want to get out\nof the fund. More likely, something exogenous has happened to the\nLPs and they are feeling tight on cash and can’t, or don’t want to,\ncomply with the capital call. This happened a number of times in the\nglobal economic crisis in the fall of 2008 (and even back in 2001)\nwhen three categories of LPs were impacted:\n1. High-net-worth individuals who were feeling lower-net-worth\nat the time;\n2. Banks that had no cash available (and quickly became parts\nof other banks); and\n3. Endowments, foundations, and charitable organizations that\nhad massive cash flow crises because of their ratio of illiquid\ninvestments.\nIn many cases, the VC will find a new LP to buy the old LP’s\ninterest. There is an active market known as a secondary market\nfor LPs who want to sell their interest. Economically, this is almost\nalways more attractive to the LP than not making a capital call, so\nexcept in moments of extreme stress, the VC usually ends up with\nthe money to make an investment.\nHow Venture Capitalists Make Money\nNow that we’ve explained the structure of a typical venture capital\nfund, let’s explore how VCs get paid. The compensation dynamics of\na particular fund often impacts the behavior of a VC early in the life\nof a company, as well as later on when the company is either succeed-\ning or struggling and needs to raise additional capital.\nManagement Fees\nVCs’ salaries come from their funds’ management fees. The manage-\nment fee is a percentage (typically between 1.5% and 2.5%) of the"}
{"page": 149, "text": "How Venture Capital Funds Work 133\ntotal amount of money committed to a fund. These fees are taken\nannually (paid out quarterly or semiannually) and finance the oper-\nations of the VC firm, including all of the salaries for the investing\npartners and their staff. For example, if a venture capital firm raises\na $100 million fund with a 2% management fee, each year the firm\nwill receive $2 million in management fees. While this may seem like\na lot of money, it goes to pay all of the costs of the venture capital\nfirm, including employees, partners, associates, rent, flying around\nthe country seeing entrepreneurs, copiers, diet soda, brand-new\nMacBook Airs, and a new iPhone every time Apple releases a new\nversion, even if it’s only a change in color.\nThe percentage is usually inversely related to the size of fund;\nthe smaller the fund, the larger the percentage—but most funds\nlevel out around 2%. There’s a slight nuance, which is the fee paid\nduring and after the commitment period, or the period of time when\nthe fund can make new investments—usually the first five years. This\nfee, which is usually 2% to 2.5%, begins to decrease after the end\nof the commitment period. The formula varies widely, but in most\nfirms the average total fee over a 10-year period is about 15% of the\ncommitted capital. So, in our previous $100 million fund example,\nthe typical fund will have $15 million of management fees to run its\noperations and pay its people.\nBut wait, there’s more. Most venture capital firms raise multiple\nfunds. The average firm raises a new fund every three or four years,\nbut some firms raise funds more frequently while others have mul-\ntiple different fund vehicles such as an early-stage fund, a growth\nstage fund, and a China fund. In these cases, the fees stack up across\nfunds. If a firm raises a fund every three years, it has a new manage-\nment fee that adds to its old management fee. The simple way to\nthink of this is that the management fee is roughly 2% of total com-\nmitted capital across all funds. So, if Fund 1 is a $100 million fund\nand Fund 2 is a $200 million fund, the management fee ends up\nbeing approximately $6 million annually ($2 million for Fund 1 and\n$4 million for Fund 2).\nAlthough venture capital firms tend to grow head count (partners\nand staff) as they raise new funds, this isn’t always the case and the\nhead count rarely grows in direct proportion to the increased man-\nagement fees. As a result, the senior partners of the venture capital\nfirm (or the ones with a managing director title) see their base com-\npensation rise with each additional fund. The dynamics vary widely"}
{"page": 150, "text": "134 Venture Deals\nfrom firm to firm, but you can assume that as the capital under man-\nagement increases, so do the fees and, as a result, the salaries of some\nof the managing directors.\nThe venture capital firm gets this management fee completely\nindependently of its investing success. Over the long term, the only\nconsequence of investment success on the fee is the ability of the\nfirm to raise additional funds. If the firm does not generate mean-\ningful positive returns, over time it will have difficulty raising addi-\ntional funds. However, this isn’t an overnight phenomenon, as the\nfee arrangements for each fund are guaranteed for 10 years. We’ve\nbeen known to say that “it takes a decade to kill a venture capital\nfirm,” and the extended fee dynamic is a key part of this.\nCarried Interest\nEven though the management fees can be substantial, in a success\ncase the real money that a VC makes, known as the carried interest,\nor carry, should dwarf the management fee. Carry is the profit that\nVCs get after returning money to their investors (the LPs). If we use\nour $100 million fund example, VCs receive their carry after they’ve\nreturned $100 million to their LPs. Most VCs get 20% of the profits\nafter returning capital (a 20% carry), although some long-standing\nor extremely successful funds take up to 30% of the profits.\nLet’s play out our example. Again, start with the $100 million\nfund. Assume that it’s a successful fund and returns 3× the capital, or\n$300 million. In this case, the first $100 million goes back to the LPs,\nand the remaining profit, or $200 million, is split 80% to the LPs and\n20% to the GPs. The venture capital firm gets $40 million in carried\ninterest and the LPs get the remaining $160 million. And yes, in this\ncase everyone is very happy.\nRemember that this firm received about $15 million of manage-\nment fees over a decade for this fund. However, there’s an interesting\nnuance here. If the fund is a $100 million fund and $15 million goes\nto management fees, doesn’t that leave only $85 million to invest? In\nsome cases it does, but VCs are allowed to recycle their management\nfee and subsequently reinvest it up to the total of $100 million. This\nassumes returns early enough in the life of the fund to recycle and\nin some cases careful cash flow management, but all firms should be\nmotivated to get the entire $100 million to work. In this case, the\n$15 million management fee can actually be viewed as a prepayment"}
{"page": 151, "text": "How Venture Capital Funds Work 135\non carry since it is essentially getting reinvested from proceeds from\nthe fund. All LPs should favor recycling, as their goal is generally\ncash-on-cash return. Getting more money to work, namely the full\n$100 million instead of only $85 million, enhances the total return.\nNote that we have been talking about the venture capital firm\nas a whole, not any individual managing director or other invest-\nment professional in the firm. An individual VC could quadruple\nthe amount of money invested in his particular companies, but still\nreceive no carry in a fund due to poor investment decisions made by\nthe other partners. In addition, most firms do not have equal alloca-\ntion of carry between partners, with the senior partners tending to\nget disproportionately more than the younger partners. Over time\nthis can be a major source of friction within the firm if there is either\ninequitable behavior from the senior partners or other firms offer\nthe young star performers better economic incentives and pick them\noff. This gets especially difficult when a fund, or a series of funds, is\nperforming poorly yet the positive returns are coming from one or\ntwo partners.\nThose of you sophisticated in the art of fund structure will note\nthat we’ve neglected to point out that LPs want their VCs to invest in\ntheir own fund. Historically, there has been a 99%/1% split between\nthe LPs and the GPs, where the VC partners put in their own money\nalongside the LPs for 1% of the fund (e.g., in our $100 million fund\nexample, the LPs would put in $99 million and the GPs would put in\n$1 million). The GP commitment historically was 1% but has floated\nup over time and is occasionally as high as 5%.\nWhile carry sounds like a wonderful thing, there is one risky situ-\nation around it called the clawback. Again, assume our $100 million\nfund. Let’s also assume the VCs have called only half of the fund\n($50 million). If the $50 million invested so far returns $80 million,\nthe fund is in a profit situation where $50 million has been returned\nand there is $30 million in profit that the VCs have the right to take\ntheir carry on. The VCs happily pocket their $6 million, assuming\nthe carry is 20%. But what happens if the VCs call and invest the rest\nof the fund and it’s a bust, returning a total of only $100 million? At\nthe end of the fund, the VCs would have invested $100 million, but\nreturned only $100 million, and as a result should get no carry.\nSo what happens to the $6 million they took in the middle of the\nfund life? The $6 million is clawed back from the VCs and given back\nto the LPs. While logical in theory, it’s harder in practice. Assume the"}
{"page": 152, "text": "136 Venture Deals\nventure capital fund has four equal partners who have each received\na $1.5 million carry check. These were happy days, followed by some\nnot so happy days when the fund performed poorly. Along the way,\ntwo of the VCs left the firm to go to other firms, and the remaining\ntwo partners no longer talk to them. In fact, one of the remaining\npartners got divorced and gave half of his money to his ex-spouse.\nAnd one of the other VCs declared bankruptcy after overextend-\ning himself financially. Oh, and all four of them have paid taxes on\ntheir carry.\nThe LPs don’t care. They want the $6 million that is owed to\nthem, and many fund agreements state that each partner is liable for\nthe full amount, regardless of what they actually received in profit\ndistributions. So, it’s possible that a subset of the partnership has to\npay back the LPs and fight with the current and former partners for\nthe rest. It’s not pretty and we wish this were only a hypothetical situ-\nation, but it’s not.\nReimbursement for Expenses\nThere is one other small income stream that VCs receive: reimburse-\nments from the companies they invest in for expenses associated\nwith board meetings. VCs will charge all reasonable expenses associ-\nated with board meetings to the company they are visiting. This usu-\nally isn’t a big deal unless your VC always flies on his private plane\nand stays at the presidential suite at your local Four Seasons hotel. In\nthe case where you feel your VC is spending excessively and charging\neverything back to the company, you should feel comfortable con-\nfronting the VC. If you aren’t, enlist one of your more frugal board\nmembers to help.\nHow Time Impacts Fund Activity\nVC fund agreements have two concepts that govern the ability to\ninvest over time. The first concept is called the commitment period.\nThe commitment period (also called “investment period”), which is\nusually five years, is the length of time that a VC has for identifying\nand investing in new companies in the fund. Once the commitment\nperiod is over, the fund can no longer invest in new companies, but\nit can invest additional money in existing portfolio companies. This\nis one of the main reasons that VC firms typically raise a new fund"}
{"page": 153, "text": "How Venture Capital Funds Work 137\nevery three to five years—once they’ve committed to all the compa-\nnies they are going to invest in from a fund, they need to raise a new\nfund to stay active as investors in new companies.\nIt’s sad but true that some VCs who are past their commitment\nperiods and have not raised new funds still meet with entrepreneurs\ntrying to raise money. In these cases, the entrepreneur has no idea\nthat there is no chance the VCs will invest, but the VCs get to pretend\nthey are still actively investing and try to maintain some semblance of\ndeal flow even though they can’t invest any longer. We first saw this\nin 2006 and 2007 as firms that raised their previous funds in 2000 or\n2001 struggled to raise new funds. Over time the media picked up\non this dynamic and started referring to these firms as the “walking\ndead”—zombie-like VCs who were still acting like VCs, earning man-\nagement fees from their old funds and actively managing their old\nportfolios, but not making new investments.\nThe good zombies are open about their status; the not-so-good\nones keep taking meetings with new companies even though they\ncan’t make new investments. It’s usually easy to spot a zombie VC—\njust ask them when they made their last new investment. If it’s more\nthan a year ago, it’s likely they are a zombie. You can also ask simple\nquestions like “How many new investments will you make out of your\ncurrent fund?” or “When do you expect to be raising a new fund?” If\nyou feel like the VC is giving you ambiguous answers, they are prob-\nably a zombie.\nThe other concept is called the investment term, or the length\nof time that the fund can remain active. New investments can be\nmade only during the commitment/investment period, but follow-\non investments can be made during the investment term. A typical\nVC fund has a 10-year investment term with two one-year options to\nextend, although some have three one-year extensions or one two-\nyear extension. Twelve years may sound like plenty of time, but when\nan early-stage fund makes a new seed investment in its fifth year and\nthe time frame for exit for an average investment can stretch out\nover a decade, 12 years is often a constraint. As a result, many early-\nstage funds go on for longer than 12 years—occasionally up to as\nmany as 17 years (or even more).\nOnce you get past 12 years, the LPs have to affirmatively vote\nevery year to have the GP continue to operate the fund. In cases in\nwhich a firm has continued to raise additional funds, the LPs are"}
{"page": 154, "text": "138 Venture Deals\ngenerally supportive of this continued fund extension activity. There\nis often a negotiation over the management fee being charged to\ncontinue to manage the fund, with it ranging from a lower percent-\nage of remaining invested capital (say, 1%) all the way to waiving the\nfee entirely. This isn’t an issue for a fi rm that has raised additional\nfunds and has the management fee from those funds to cover its\noperations, but it is a major issue for zombie fi rms that fi nd their\nannual operating fees materially declining. Time is not the friend\nof a zombie fi rm, as partners begin to leave for greener pastures,\nspend less and less time helping the companies they’ve invested in,\nor simply start pushing the companies to sell and generate liquidity.\nIn some cases, entire portfolios are sold to new fi rms via what\nis called a secondary sale in which someone else takes over manag-\ning the portfolio through the liquidation of the companies. In these\ncases, the people the entrepreneurs are dealing with, including their\nboard members, can change completely. These secondary buyers\noften have very different agendas than the original investor, usually\nmuch more focused on driving the company to a speedy exit, even at\na lower value than the other LPs.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nOne important thing to understand about your prospective investor’s fund is how\nold the fund is. The closer the fund is to its end of life, the more problematic\nthings can become for you in terms of investor pressure for liquidity (in which\nyour interests and the investor’s might not be aligned), or an investor require-\nment to distribute shares in your company to LPs, which could be horrible for\nyou if the fi rm has a large number of LPs who then become direct shareholders.\nReserves\nReserves are the amount of investment capital that is allocated to each\ncompany that a VC invests in. This is a very important concept that\nmost entrepreneurs don’t pay proper attention to. Imagine that a\nVC invests $1 million in the fi rst round of your company. When they\nmake the investment, the VC will reserve a theoretical future amount\nof the fund to invest in follow-on rounds. The VC generally won’t tell\nyou this amount, but it’s usually a well-defi ned amount within the\nventure capital fi rm."}
{"page": 155, "text": "How Venture Capital Funds Work 139\nTypically, but not always, the earlier the stage a company is at,\nthe more reserves the VC will allocate. In the case of a late stage\ninvestment immediately prior to an initial public offering (IPO), a\nVC might not have any reserves allocated to a company, whereas a\nfirst-round investment might have reserves of $10 million or more\nassociated with it.\nWhile most VCs will ask the entrepreneur about future funding\nneeds prior to making an investment, many VCs ignore this number\nand come up with their own views of the future financing dynamics\nand the corresponding reserves amount. In our experience, entre-\npreneurs are often optimistic about how much capital they need,\nestimating on the low side. VCs will rely on their own experience\nwhen figuring out reserves and will often be conservative and esti-\nmate high early in the life of the investment, reducing this number\nover time as a company ages.\nLet’s look at how reserve analysis can impact a company. Assume\na venture capital firm has a $100 million fund and invests a total of\n$50 million into 10 different companies. Assume also that the ven-\nture capital firm has an aggregate of $50 million in reserves divided\nbetween the 10 companies. While it doesn’t matter if the firm is\naccurately reserved on a company by company basis at the begin-\nning, the total amount reserved and how it is deployed over time are\ncritical. If the VC has underreserved and $70 million ends up being\nneeded in aggregate to support the ongoing funding of the 10 com-\npanies, the VC firm won’t have the ability to continue to fund all of\nthe companies it is an investor in. This usually results in VCs picking\nfavorites and not supporting some of the companies. Although this\ncan manifest itself as VCs simply walking away from their investments\nor being direct that they have no additional money to invest, the\nbehavior by the VC is usually more mysterious. The less upfront VC\nwill often actively resist additional financings, try to limit the size and\nsubsequently the dilution of these financings, or push you to sell the\ncompany. In cases where a pay-to-play term is in effect, you’ll often\nsee more resistance to additional financings as the venture capital\nfirm tries to protect its position in the company, even if it’s not neces-\nsarily the right thing to do for the business.\nOverreserving, or reserving $50 million when you ultimately\nneed only $30 million, is also an issue, but it doesn’t impact the entre-\npreneurs. Overreserving results in the VC underinvesting the fund,\nwhich is economically disadvantageous to the LPs and the VCs. The"}
{"page": 156, "text": "140 Venture Deals\nLPs want all of the fund capital to be invested because it increases\nthe chance of returning more capital. The VCs also want to get all\nthe money to work, especially when funds become profi table, as the\ngreater the absolute return, the greater the carry.\nMost venture capital fund agreements allow a fi rm to raise a new\nfund once they are around 70% committed and reserved. While this\nthreshold varies by fi rms, it is usually reasonably high. As a result,\nthere is a slight motivation to overreserve to reach this threshold\nthat is countered by the negative economic dynamics of not fully\ninvesting the fund. Of course, independent of the threshold, the VC\nstill needs to have good performance and the support of the existing\ninvestors to raise a new fund.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nYou should understand how much capital the fi rm reserves for follow-on invest-\nments per company, or in the case of your company in particular. If you think\nyour company is likely to need multiple rounds of fi nancing, you want to make\nsure the VC has plenty of “dry powder” in reserve for your company so you don’t\nend up in contentious situations down the road in which your investor has no\nmore money left to invest and is then at odds with you or with future investors.\nCash Flow\nVCs have to pay as much attention to cash fl ow as entrepreneurs do,\nalthough many don’t until they run into trouble. Remember that the\ncapital raised by a venture fi rm can be used for investments in com-\npanies, management fees, and expenses of the fund, which include\npaying accountants for an annual audit and tax fi lings and paying\nlawyers for any litigation issues. Also remember that LPs want their\nVCs to invest 100% of the fund in companies.\nIf a VC has a $100 million fund with a typical management fee,\napproximately $15 million will be spent on noninvesting activity\nduring the life of the fund. This means to fully invest the $100 mil-\nlion, the fund will need to generate $15 million of returns that it can\nrecycle—or invest—over the life of the fund. More important is that\ntiming matters since the exits that generate this additional cash are\nunpredictable, and as a fund gets later in its life, it can start to get\ninto a position where it doesn’t actually have the cash to recycle.\nIn the most extreme case, the fi rm will underreserve and not\nmanage cash fl ow effectively. As a result, it will fi nd itself crunched"}
{"page": 157, "text": "How Venture Capital Funds Work 141\nat both ends. It won’t have adequate reserves to continue to support\nits investments and, even if it did, it won’t have the cash to pay its\nemployees through management fees. This situation can occur even\nin firms that have raised follow-on funds, as the cash flow dynamics\nof recycling are fund specific.\nCross-Fund Investing\nMany venture capital firms invest out of several linked fund entities\n(e.g., you may have two funds as investors in your fund—VC Fund III\nand VC Entrepreneurs Fund III); however, there are also cases where\nfirms will fund out of two completely separate funds, say VC Fund III\nand VC Fund IV. These are called cross-fund investments. Typically, you’ll\nsee this when the first fund (Fund III) is underreserved and the second\nfund (Fund IV) fills in the gap to help the venture capital firm as a\nwhole protect its position and provide support for the company.\nCross-fund investing can lead to several problems between the\nventure capital firm and its LPs. Cross-fund investing is rarely done\nfrom the beginning of an investment, so the later rounds are done at\na different price (not always higher) than the earlier rounds. Since\nthe underlying funds almost always have different LP composition\nand each fund will end up with a different return profile on the\nexit, the LPs won’t be treated economically equally across the invest-\nment. In the upside case where the valuation is steadily increasing,\nthis won’t matter, as everyone will be happy with the positive eco-\nnomic outcome. However, in the downside case, or an upside case\nwhere the round that the second fund invests in is a down round,\nthis is a no-win situation for the VC. In this situation, one fund will\nbe disadvantaged over the other and some LPs will end up in a worse\nsituation than they would have been in if the cross-fund investment\nhadn’t happened. And if our friendly VC thinks too hard, the eco-\nnomic conflict will start to melt his brain.\nThe one exception is when an early-stage firm creates a growth\nfund to invest in their successful companies. These funds are often\ncalled Opportunity or Select funds and are a logical way for early-\nstage investors to participate in their winners at later stages.\nDeparting Partners\nMost venture capital firms have a key man clause that defines what\nhappens in the case in which a certain number of partners or a spe-\ncific partner leaves the firm. In some cases, when a firm trips the key"}
{"page": 158, "text": "142 Venture Deals\nman clause, the LPs have the right to suspend the ability of the fund\nto make new investments or can even shut down the fund. In cases\nwhere a partner leaves the firm but doesn’t trip the key man clause,\nthere are often contentious issues over firm economics, especially if\nthe firm has been poorly structured, doesn’t have appropriate vest-\ning, or has a significant amount of economics in the hands of the\ndeparting partner, leaving the other partners with insignificant moti-\nvation (at least in their minds) for continuing to actively manage\nthe firm. While the entrepreneur can’t impact this, it’s important to\nbe sensitive to any potential dynamics in the structure of the firm,\nespecially if the departing partner is the one who sits on your board\nor has sponsored the investment in your company.\nCorporate Venture Capital\nIn the past few years we have seen the emergence of numerous cor-\nporate venture capital (CVC) groups. These are VCs who have a\nlarge corporation behind them, and are usually easy to identify since\nthey go by names like Google Ventures (now GV), Intel Ventures,\nQualcomm Ventures, Salesforce Ventures, and Microsoft Ventures.\nToday, there are several hundred CVCs. As with traditional venture\ncapital firms, they vary greatly in size, shape, strategy, and incentives.\nCVC, however, is not a new phenomenon, as it has been around\nfor decades. There was a huge increase in the number of CVCs in\nthe late 1990s leading up to the peak of the Internet bubble, with a\ncorrespondingly rapid evaporation of these firms after the Internet\nbubble burst. Over the past decade they’ve began to emerge again,\nwith a recent, rapid increase in the number of firms.\nUnlike a traditional VC that reports to its limited partners, CVCs\nmay answer to executive management teams, other company depart-\nments, public shareholders, or even quarterly results. While some\nCVCs are indistinguishable from traditional VCs, many CVCs invest\noff of their companies’ balance sheets and as a result don’t have sep-\narate fund structures. When the CVC is not a separate entity, but one\nthat reports up to the CEO or other executive (sometimes the chief\nfinancial officer [CFO]) of a large public company, many different\npressures come into play beside a direct focus on financial returns.\nAvailability of capital to invest shifts with changes in a company’s\nstock price and balance sheet, which can have significant impact on\na startup’s ability to raise additional capital from the CVC."}
{"page": 159, "text": "How Venture Capital Funds Work 143\nTeams at CVCs often experience employee turnover, especially\nif the CVC has star performers who are incented with equity in their\npublic company rather than economics associated with their invest-\nment returns. These CVC partners are easy pickings for many tradi-\ntional venture capital firms who are looking to grow as compensa-\ntion, autonomy, and authority is often significantly higher in venture\ncapital firms than in CVCs.\nMotivations around valuation, structure, and control in subse-\nquent financings or merger and acquisition (M&A) activity is often\ndifferent between VCs and CVCs. In addition to how a typical VC\nis motivated, CVCs often, but not always, have other interests in\nbecoming investors in your company including insight into your\ntechnology, partnering around a distribution channel or go to mar-\nket approach, or locking out a competitor. As a result, CVCs are\noften willing to pay a higher valuation than VCs given these addi-\ntional motivations. At the same time, CVCs often look for more\ncontrol, such as a first right of refusal on an acquisition (something\nyou should never, ever give). While the higher valuation might feel\ngood, realize that if it’s too high it may negatively impact your next\nround of financing.\nSome CVCs will take board seats, but many do not require\nanything beyond observer roles on the boards. Lawyers at a CVC\nparent company are often concerned about potential conflicts of\ninterest that might arise along with issues around information pro-\nperty linkage.\nCompensation varies widely between CVCs and often differs sig-\nnificantly from the management fee/carried interest approach of VC\nfirms. Many CVCs are simply employees of their parent companies\nwith salary, bonus, and stock option pay packages. In some cases, the\nCVC has a bonus plan tied to company performance, but it’s rarely\nequivalent to the economics of a traditional VC firm.\nFinally, be mindful of potential conflicts, especially around tech-\nnology and customers. As one of the motivations for a CVCs is to have\ninsight and/or access to innovative companies and their products, they\noften are investing in companies they think can become large, long-\nterm users of the CVC’s parent company technology and products.\nWhile this can be powerful, consider what happens to the relationship\nwhen you decide to use a competitor’s technology over that of your\nCVC or when one day you wake up and realize that the CVC’s parent\ncompany has come out with a product that competes with yours."}
{"page": 160, "text": "144 Venture Deals\nStrategic Investors\nWhile many CVCs also consider themselves strategic investors, there\nare many strategic investors that aren’t formalized as venture capital\ninvestors. These are companies that aren’t in the business of making\nventure capital investments, but for a particular reason want to invest\nin your company. For instance, suppose you produce a consumer\ndevice in China and your contract manufacturer tells you they want\nto invest in your company. While flattering, there are both positive\nand negative aspects to this.\nAs with CVCs, strategic investors are incentivized differently,\nhave different masters to answer to, and have varying motivations for\ntheir investments beyond overall returns.\nSuppose you are the founder of a company called SwearJar.com,\nwhich makes a wearable device that detects foul language uttered by\nthe wearer. Upon such detection, it automatically debits your bank\naccount and sends 80% of the proceeds to charity and 20% to Swear-\nJar (yup, we’ve seen this, and are a particularly good customer target).\nYour product is manufactured at ChinaFab, Inc. and they’ve offered\nto invest $1 million in your company. They have indicated that they\ndon’t care about the valuation and are happy to participate at what-\never your last round was priced at. You need the money, would love\nto be more tightly connected to your manufacturing partner, and\nare inclined to take it.\nBefore you get too excited, consider what will happen to their\nservice to you as your manufacturer. If they have experience mak-\ning strategic investments, explore whether things have gotten better\nor worse after they made this strategic investment. In addition to\nseeing some strategic investors start taking companies like SwearJar\nfor granted after they’ve invested, people in the strategic partner\norganization begin to justify their performance as a result of hav-\ning an investment in the company. Now, you want to hold them\naccountable by spinning up a competitive process for another con-\ntract manufacturer. At best, this is awkward and often can negatively\nimpact your business relationship. But, your strategic investor will\nstill be an equity owner of your company, making things even more\ncomplicated.\nOften, the strategic investor will be helpful and the relationship\nwill be a constructive one. For confident strategic investors, they often"}
{"page": 161, "text": "How Venture Capital Funds Work 145\nask for additional equity consideration for helping your company\nsucceed. While this ignores the fact that your VC investors aren’t get-\nting additional equity compensation for helping you, strategic inves-\ntors often feel entitled to something. In these cases, we encourage\nyou to use a performance warrant.\nAs with a regular warrant, a performance warrant is an option for\nthe strategic partner to buy stock in your company (usually common\nstock) at a set price (often the most recent financing round price).\nUnlike a regular warrant, the performance warrant is issued only\nwhen the strategic investor accomplishes predetermined perfor-\nmance goals. In this situation, if they perform, you reward them with\nthe performance warrant. If they don’t perform, they still received\ntheir equity in exchange for their investment, but they didn’t get the\nextra equity they were looking for.\nFiduciary Duties\nVCs owe fiduciary duties, concurrently and on the same importance\nlevel, to their management company, to the GP, to the LP, and to\neach board that they serve on. If your investor is a CVC or strategic\ninvestor, they will owe a fiduciary duty back to their parent organiza-\ntion. Normally, this all works out fine if one is dealing with a credible\nand legitimate firm, but even in the best of cases, these duties can\nconflict with one another and both VCs and CVCs can find them-\nselves in a fiduciary sandwich.\nFor the entrepreneur, it’s important to remember that no mat-\nter how much you love your investors, they answer to other people\nand have a complex set of formal, legal responsibilities. Some inves-\ntors understand this well, are transparent, and have a clearly defined\nset of internal guidelines when they find themselves in the midst of\nfiduciary conflicts. Others don’t and subsequently act in confusing,\ncomplicated, and occasionally difficult ways.\nMore annoyingly to those of us who understand this dynamic,\nsome investors pontificate about their fiduciary duties while not\nreally knowing what to do. If you ever feel uncomfortable with the\ndynamic, remember that your legal counsel represents your com-\npany and can help you cut through the noise to understand what is\nreally going on."}

We’ve found that most\npeople, including many lawyers, are weak negotiators. Fortunately\nfor our current and future portfolio company executives, they can\nread about everything we know online and in this book, so hopefully\nin addition to being better negotiators, they now know all of our\nmoves and can negotiate more effectively against us.\nThere are plenty of treatises on negotiations; however, this chap-\nter walks through some negotiation tactics that have worked well for\nus over the years. Although this book is primarily about financings,\nwe’ll talk about a range of negotiation tactics that you can use in\nyour life, and we illustrate some of the different types of characters\nyou’ll probably meet along the way.\nWhat Really Matters?\nThere are only three things that matter when negotiating a financ-\ning: achieving a good and fair result, not killing your personal rela-\ntionship getting there, and understanding the deal that you are\nstriking.\nIt has been said that a good deal means neither party is happy.\nThis might be true in litigation or acquisitions, but if neither party is\nhappy following the closing of a venture financing, then you have a\nreal problem. Remember, the financing is only the beginning of the\nrelationship and a small part at that. Building the company together\n147"}
{"page": 164, "text": "148 Venture Deals\nwhile having a productive and good relationship is what matters. A\ngreat starting point is for both sides to think they have achieved a fair\nresult and feel lucky to be in business with one another. If you behave\npoorly during the fi nancing, it’s likely that tensions will be strained for\nsome time if the deal actually gets closed. And if your lawyer behaved\nbadly during the negotiation, it’s likely that lawyer will be looking for a\nnew client after the venture capitalist (VC) joins the board.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nYour lawyer shouldn’t be a jerk in manner or unreasonable in positions, but this\ndoesn’t mean you should advise your lawyer to behave in a milquetoast manner\nduring negotiations, especially if he is well versed in venture fi nancings. You\nneed to manage this carefully as the entrepreneur, even if your eyes glaze over\nat legalese. This is your company and your deal, not your lawyer’s.\nAs for which deal terms matter, we’ve talked previously about\neconomics and control. We’d suggest that any signifi cant time you\nare spending negotiating beyond these two core concepts is a waste\nof time. You can learn a lot about the person you are negotiating\nwith by what that individual focuses on.\nPick a few things that really matter—the valuation, stock option\npool, liquidation preferences, board, and voting controls—and be\ndone with it. The cliché “you never make money on terms” is espe-\ncially true outside of a few key ones that we’ve dwelled on already.\nThe good karma that will attach to you from the other side (assum-\ning they aren’t jerks) will be well worth it.\nPreparing for the Negotiation\nThe single biggest mistake people make during negotiation is a lack\nof preparation. It’s incredible to us that people will walk blindly into\na negotiation when so much is on the line. And this isn’t just about\nventure deals, as we’ve seen this behavior in all types of negotiations.\nMany people don’t prepare because they feel they don’t know\nwhat they should prepare for. We’ll give you some ideas, but realize\nthat you probably do know how to negotiate better than you think.\nYou already negotiate many times a day during your interactions in\nlife, but most people generally just do it and don’t think too hard\nabout it. If you have a spouse, child, auto mechanic, domesticated"}

Have key things that you want, understand which\nterms you are willing to concede, and know when you are willing to\nwalk away. If you try to determine this during the negotiation, your\nemotions are likely to get the best of you and you’ll make mistakes.\nAlways have a plan.\nNext, spend some time beforehand getting to know whom you\nare dealing with. Some people (like us) are so easy to find that you\ncan Google us and know just about everything we think. If we openly\nstate that we think people who negotiate registration rights in a term\nsheets are idiots (which we do), then why on Earth would you or your\nlawyer make a big deal about it? This being said, more than 50% of\nthe term sheet markups we get from lawyers have requested changes\nto the registration rights section, which makes us instantly look down\non the lawyer and know that the entrepreneur isn’t the one running\nthe show. (Yes, we keep a list of these law firms.)\nIf you get to know the other side ahead of time, you might also\nbe able to play to their strengths, weaknesses, biases, curiosities, and\ninsecurities. The saying “knowledge is power” applies here. And\nremember, just because you can gain the upper hand in using this\ntype of knowledge doesn’t mean that you have to, but it will serve as\na security blanket and might be necessary if things turn south.\nOne thing to remember: everyone has an advantage over every-\none else in all negotiations. There might be a David to the Goliath, but\neven David knew a few things that the big man didn’t. Life is the same\nway. Figure out your superpower and your adversary’s kryptonite.\nIf you are a first-time, 20-something entrepreneur negotiating a\nterm sheet against a 40-something, well-weathered, and experienced\nVC, what possible advantage could you have on the VC? The VC\nclearly understands the terms better. The VC also has a ton of market\nknowledge. And let’s assume that this VC is the only credible fund-\ning source that you have. Sounds pretty bleak, right?\nWell, yes, but don’t despair. There is one immediate advantage\nthat you probably have: time. If we generalize, it’s easy to come up\nwith a scenario of the VC having a family and lots of portfolio com-\npanies and investors to deal with. You, on the other hand, have one\nsingular focus: your company and this negotiation. You can afford to\nmake the process a longer one than the VC might want. In fact, most"}

Perhaps you’ll want to\nset up your negotiation call at the end of the day, right before the\nVC’s dinner. Or maybe you’ll sweetly ask your VC to explain a host of\nterms that you “don’t understand” and further put burdens on the\nVC’s time. Think this doesn’t happen? After we gave this advice to\nsome of the Techstars (see www.techstars.com ) teams in 2009, one\nof the teams waited until two hours before Jason left on vacation to\nnegotiate the term sheet we gave them. Jason didn’t even recognize\nthis as their strategy and fi gured it was bad luck with timing. As a\nresult, he faced time pressure that was artifi cially manufactured by\na 20-something fi rst-time entrepreneur. Nice job, Alex. (Alex White,\nformer CEO of Next Big Sound, which was acquired by Pandora).\nThere are advantages all over the place. Is your VC a huge Stan-\nford fan? Chat her up and fi nd out if she has courtside seats to the\ngame. Is your VC into a charity that you care about? Use this infor-\nmation to connect with her so she becomes more sympathetic. While\nsimple things like this are endless, what matters is that you have a\nplan, know the other side, and consider what natural advantages you\nhave. In a perfect world, you won’t have to use any of these tools, but\nif you need them and don’t bring them to the actual negotiation, it’s\nyour loss.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nYour biggest advantage is to have a solid Plan B—lots of interest and competi-\ntion for your deal. VCs will fold like a house of cards on all peripheral terms if\nyou have another comparable quality VC waiting in the wings to work with you.\nA Brief Introduction to Game Theory\nEveryone has a natural negotiating style. These styles have analogues\nthat can work either well or poorly in trying to achieve a negotiated\nresult. It’s important to understand how certain styles work well\ntogether, how some confl ict, and how some have inherent advantages\nover one another.\nBefore we delve into that, let’s spend a little time on basic game\ntheory. G ame theory is a mathematical theory that deals with strategies"}
{"page": 167, "text": "Negotiation Tactics 151\nfor maximizing gains and minimizing losses within prescribed con-\nstraints, such as the rules of a card game. Game theory is widely applied\nin the solution of various decision-making problems, such as those of\nmilitary strategy and business policy.\nGame theory states that there are rules underlying situations\nthat affect how these situations will be played out. These rules are\nindependent of the humans involved and will predict and change\nhow humans interact within the constructs of the situation. Knowing\nwhat these invisible rules are is of major importance when entering\ninto any type of negotiation.\nThe most famous of all games is the prisoner’s dilemma, which you’ve\nseen many times if you’ve ever watched a cop show on television. The\nsimple form, as described in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\n(http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/prisoner-dilemma/#Sym2t2PDOrd\nPay), follows:\nTanya and Cinque have been arrested for robbing the Hibernia\nSavings Bank and placed in separate isolation cells. Both care\nmuch more about their personal freedom than about the wel-\nfare of their accomplice. A clever prosecutor makes the follow-\ning offer to each. “You may choose to confess or remain silent.\nIf you confess and your accomplice remains silent, I will drop all\ncharges against you and use your testimony to ensure that your\naccomplice does serious time. Likewise, if your accomplice con-\nfesses while you remain silent, they will go free while you do the\ntime. If you both confess, I get two convictions, but I’ll see to it\nthat you both get early parole. If you both remain silent, I’ll have\nto settle for token sentences on firearms possession charges. If\nyou wish to confess, you must leave a note with the jailer before\nmy return tomorrow morning.”\nThe classic prisoner’s dilemma can be summarized as shown in\nthe following table.\nClassic Prisoner’s Dilemma\nPrisoner B Stays Silent Prisoner B Betrays\nPrisoner A Stays Silent Each serves 8 months Prisoner A: 12 years\nPrisoner B: goes free\nPrisoner A Betrays Prisoner A: goes free Each serves 5 years\nPrisoner B: 12 years"}
{"page": 168, "text": "152 Venture Deals\nWhat’s fascinating about this is that there is a fundamental rule\nin this game that demonstrates why two people might not cooperate\nwith one another, even if it is clearly in their best interests to do so.\nIf the two prisoners cooperate, the outcome is best, in the aggre-\ngate, for both of them. They each get eight months of jail time\nand walk away. But the game forces different behavior. Regardless\nof what the co-conspirator chooses (silence versus betrayal), each\nplayer always receives a lighter sentence by betraying the other. In\nother words, no matter what the other guy does, you are always bet-\nter off by ratting him out.\nThe other rule to this game is that it is a single-play game. In other\nwords, the participants play the game once and their fate is cast.\nOther games are multiplay games. For instance, there is a lot of inter-\nesting game theory about battlegrounds. If you are in one trench\nfighting and we are in another, game theory would suggest that\nwe would not fight at night, on weekends, on holidays, and during\nmeals. Why not? It would seem logical that if we know you are sleep-\ning, it’s the absolute best time to attack.\nWell, it’s not, unless we can completely take you out with one\nstrike. Otherwise, you’ll most likely start attacking us during dinner,\non holidays, or while we are watching Mad Men. And then not only\nare we still fighting, but now we’ve both lost our free time. This tit-for-\ntat strategy is what keeps multiplay games at equilibrium. If you don’t\nmess with us during our lunch break, we won’t mess with you during\nyours. And everyone is better off. But if you do mess with us, we’ll\ncontinue to mess with you until you are nice to us again.\nWhen you are considering which game you are playing, consider\nnot only whether there are forces at work that influence the deci-\nsions being made, like the prisoner’s dilemma, but also how many\ntimes a decision will be made. Is this a one-shot deal, or will this\ngame repeat itself, lending increased importance to precedent and\nreputation?\nNegotiating in the Game of Financings\nA venture financing is one of the easiest games there is. First, you\nreally can have a win-win outcome where everyone is better off.\nSecond, you don’t negotiate in a vacuum like your hypothetical\nfellow criminal co-conspirator. Finally, and most important, this is\nnot a single instance game. Therefore, reputation and the fear of\ntit-for-tat retaliation are real considerations."}
{"page": 169, "text": "Negotiation Tactics 153\nSince the VC and entrepreneur will need to spend a lot of time\ntogether post investment, the continued relationship makes it impor-\ntant to look at the fi nancing as just one negotiation in a very long,\nmultiplay game. Doing anything that would give the other party an\nincentive to retaliate in the future is not a wise, or rational, move.\nFurthermore, for the VC, this fi nancing is but one of many that\nthe VC will hope to complete. Therefore, the VC should be thinking\nabout reputational factors that extend well beyond this particular\ninteraction. With the maturation of the venture capital industry, it’s\neasy to get near-perfect information on most VCs. Having a negative\nreputation can be fatal to a VC in the long run.\nNot all VCs recognize that each negotiation isn’t a single-round,\nwinner-take-all game. Generally, the more experience VCs have, the\nbetter their perspective is, but this lack of a longer-term view is not\nlimited to junior VCs. While we’ll often see this behavior more from\nthe lawyers representing the VCs or the entrepreneurs, we also see it\nfrom the business principals. When we run across people like this, at\na minimum we lose a lot of respect for them and occasionally decide\nnot to do business with them. When you encounter VCs who either\nhave a reputation for or are acting as though every negotiation is a\nsingle-round, winner-take-all game, you should be very cautious.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nOne successful negotiating tactic is to ask VCs up front, before the term sheet\nshows up, what the three most important terms are in a fi nancing for them. You\nshould know and be prepared to articulate your top three wants as well. This\nconversation can set the stage for how you think about negotiating down the\nroad, and it can be helpful to you when you are in the heat of a negotiation. If\nthe VCs are pounding hard on a point that is not one of their stated top three,\nit’s much easier to call them out on that fact and note that they are getting most\nor all of their main points.\nGame theory is also useful because of the other types of negotia-\ntions you’ll have. For instance, if you decide to sell your company,\nyour acquisition discussions can be similar to the prisoner’s dilemma\nas presented earlier. Customer negotiations usually take on the feel-\ning of a single-round game, despite any thoughts to the contrary\nabout partnerships. And litigation almost always takes the form of a\nsingle-round game, even when the parties will have ongoing relation-\nships beyond the resolution of the litigation."}
{"page": 170, "text": "154 Venture Deals\nRemember, you can’t change the game you are in, but you can\njudge people who play poorly within it. And having a game theory\nlens to view the other side is very useful.\nNegotiating Styles and Approaches\nEvery person has a natural negotiating style that is often the part\nof your personality that you adopt when you are dealing with con-\nflict. Few people have truly different modes for negotiation, but that\ndoesn’t mean you can’t practice having a range of different behav-\niors that depend on the situation you are in.\nMost good negotiators know where they are comfortable, but\nalso know how to play upon and against other people’s natural styles.\nFollowing are some of the personalities you’ll meet and how you\nmight want to best work with them.\nThe Bully (aka UAW Negotiator)\nThe bully negotiates by yelling and screaming, forcing issues, and\nthreatening the other party. Most folks who are bullies aren’t that\nsmart and don’t really understand the issues; rather, they try to win\nby force. There are two ways to deal with bullies: punch them in the\nnose or mellow out so much that you sap their strength. If you can\noutbully the bully, go for it. But if you are wrong, then you’ve prob-\nably ignited a volcano. Unlike the children’s playground, getting hit\nby a bully during a negotiation generally doesn’t hurt; so unless this\nis your natural negotiating style, our advice is to chill out as your\nadversary gets hotter.\nThe Nice Guy (aka Used-Car Salesman)\nWhenever you interact with this pleasant person, you feel like he’s\ntrying to sell you something. Often, you aren’t sure that you want\nwhat he’s selling. When you say no, the nice guy will either be openly\ndisappointed or will keep on smiling at you just like the audience\nat a Tony Robbins event. In their world, life is great as long as you\nacquiesce to their terms (or buy this clean 2006 Chrysler Sebring).\nAs the negotiation unfolds, the nice guy is increasingly hard to pin\ndown on anything. While the car salesman always needs to go talk\nto his manager, the nice-guy negotiator regularly responds with “Let\nme consider that and get back to you.” While the nice guy doesn’t"}
{"page": 171, "text": "Negotiation Tactics 155\nyell at you like the bully, it’s often frustrating that you can never get\na real answer or seemingly make progress. Our advice is to be clear\nand direct and don’t get worn down, as the nice guys will happily talk\nto you all day. If all else fails, don’t be afraid to toss a little bully into\nthe mix on your side to move things forward.\nThe Technocrat (aka Pocket Protector Guy)\nThis is the technical nerd guy. Although he won’t yell at you like the\nbully and you don’t wonder if there is a real human being behind\nthe facade like you do with the nice guy, you will feel like you are\nin endless detail hell. The technocrat has a billion issues and has\na hard time deciding what’s really important, since to him every-\nthing is important for some reason. Our advice is to grin and bear it\nand perhaps play Pokémon GO while you are listening to the other\nside drone on. Technocrats tend to cause you to lose your focus dur-\ning the negotiation. Make sure you don’t by remembering what you\ncare about and conceding the other points. But make sure you cover\nall the points together, as the technocrat will often negotiate every\npoint from scratch, not taking into consideration the give-and-take\nof each side during the negotiation.\nThe Wimp (aka George McFly)\nThe wimp may sound like the perfect dance partner here, but he\nhas his own issues. Our bet is that you can take his wallet pretty easily\nduring the negotiation, but if you get too good a deal it will come\nback to haunt you. And then you get to live with him on your board\nof directors once you close your financing. With the wimp, you end\nup negotiating both sides of the deal. Sometimes this is harder than\nhaving a real adversary.\nThe Curmudgeon (aka Archie Bunker)\nWith the curmudgeon, everything you negotiate sucks. No matter\nwhat you arrive at is horrible, and every step along the way during\nthe negotiation will feel like a dentist tugging on a tight molar at the\nback of your mouth. Unlike the bully, the curmudgeon won’t yell;\nand unlike the nice guy, she’s never happy. While it’ll seem like she\ndoesn’t care too much about the details, she’s just never happy with\nany position you are taking. The curmudgeon is also not a wimp;"}
{"page": 172, "text": "156 Venture Deals\nshe’s been around the block before and will remind you of that every\nchance she gets. In a lot of ways, the curmudgeon is like a cranky\ngrandmother. If you are patient, upbeat, and tolerant, you’ll even-\ntually get what you want, but you’ll never really please her because\neveryone pisses her off.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nYou learn a lot about a person in a negotiation. This is one argument for doing\nas much of the detailed negotiation before signing a term sheet that includes\na no-shop clause in it. If you fi nd that your potential investor is a jerk to you in\nnegotiating your deal, you may want to think twice about this person becoming\na board member and member of your inner circle.\nAlways Be Transparent\nWhat about the normal dude? You know, the transparent, nice,\nsmart, levelheaded person you hope to meet on the other side of the\ntable? Though they exist, everyone has some inherent styles that will\nfi nd their way into the negotiation, especially if pressed or negotia-\ntions aren’t going well. Make sure you know which styles you have so\nyou won’t surprise yourself with a sudden outburst. You’ll also see a\nlot of these behaviors come out real-time in board meetings when\nthings aren’t going quite as well as hoped.\nIf you are capable of having multiple negotiating personalities,\nwhich should you favor? We’d argue that in a negotiation that has\nreputational and relationship value, try to be the most transparent\nand easygoing that you can be, to let the other person inside your\nthinking and get to know you for who you really are. If you are play-\ning a single-round game, like an acquisition negotiation with a party\nyou don’t ever expect to do business with again, do like Al Davis says:\n“Just win, baby.” As in sports, don’t ever forget that a good tactic is to\nchange your game plan suddenly to keep the other side on their toes.\nCollaborative Negotiation versus Walk-Away Threats\nOf all the questions we get regarding negotiations, the most com-\nmon is when to walk away from a deal. Most people’s blood pressure\nticks up a few points with the thought of walking away, especially"}
{"page": 173, "text": "Negotiation Tactics 157\nafter you’ve invested a lot of time and energy (especially emotional\nenergy) in a negotiation. In considering whether to walk away from\na negotiation, preparation is key here—know what your walk-away\npoint is before starting the negotiation so it’s a rational and deliber-\nate decision rather than an emotional one made in the heat of the\nmoment.\nWhen determining your walk-away position, consider your best\nalternative to negotiated agreement, also known in business school circles\nas BATNA. Specifically, what is your backup plan if you aren’t success-\nful reaching an agreement? The answer to this varies wildly depend-\ning on the circumstances. In a financing, if you are lucky, your\nbackup plan may be accepting your second-favorite term sheet from\nanother VC. It could mean bootstrapping your company and forgo-\ning a financing. Understanding BATNA is important in any negotia-\ntion, such as an acquisition (walk away as a stand-alone company),\nlitigation (settle versus go to court), and customer contract (walk\naway rather than get stuck in a bad deal).\nBefore you begin any negotiation, make sure you know where\nyour overall limits are, as well as your limits on each key point. If\nyou’ve thought this through in advance, you’ll know when someone\nis trying to move you past one of these boundaries. It’s also usually\nobvious when someone tries to pretend they are at a boundary when\nthey really aren’t. Few people are able to feign true conviction.\nAt some point in some negotiation, you’ll find yourself up\nagainst the wall or being pushed into a zone that is beyond where\nyou are willing to go. In this situation, tell the other party there is\nno deal, and walk away. As you walk away, be very clear with what\nyour walk-away point is so the other party will be able to reconsider\ntheir position. If you are sincere in walking away and the other party\nis interested enough in a deal, they’ll likely be back at the table at\nsome point and will offer you something that you can stomach. If\nthey don’t reengage, the deal wasn’t meant to be.\nDepending on the type of person you are negotiating with, the\nVC either will be sensitive to your boundaries or will force you out-\nside these boundaries, where BATNA will come into effect. If this is\nhappening regularly during your financing negotiation, think hard\nabout whether this is a VC that you want to be working with, as this\nVC is likely playing a single-round game in a relationship that will\nhave many rounds and lots of ups and downs along the way."}
{"page": 174, "text": "158 Venture Deals\nFinally, don’t ever make a threat during a negotiation that you\naren’t willing to back up. If you bluff and aren’t willing to back up\nyour position, your bargaining position is forever lost in this negotia-\ntion. The 17th time we hear “and that’s our fi nal offer,” we know that\nthere’s another, better offer coming if we just hold out for number 18.\nBuilding Leverage and Getting to Yes\nBesides understanding the issues and knowing how to deal with the\nother party, there are certain things that you can do to increase your\nnegotiation leverage. In a VC fi nancing, the best way to gain leverage\nis to have competing term sheets from different VCs.\nIf you happen to be lucky enough to have several interested par-\nties, this will be the single biggest advantage in getting good deal\nterms. However, it’s a tricky balance dealing with multiple parties at\nthe same time. You have to worry about issues of transparency and\ntiming and, if you play them incorrectly, you might fi nd yourself in a\nsituation where no one wants to work with you.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nAs I mentioned earlier, having a solid Plan B (and a Plan C, and a Plan D . . .) is\none of your most effective weapons during the negotiation process. It’s helpful to\nbe reasonably transparent about that fact to all prospective investors. While it’s\na good practice to withhold some information, such as the names of the other\npotential investors with whom you’re speaking since there is no reason to enable\ntwo VCs to talk about your deal behind your back, telling investors that you have\nlegitimate interest from other fi rms will serve you very well in terms of speeding\nthe process along and improving your end result.\nFor starters, pay attention to timing. You’ll want to try to drive\neach VC to deliver a term sheet to you in roughly the same time\nframe. This pacing can be challenging since there will be uncomfort-\nable days when you’ll end up slow rolling one party while you seek to\nspeed up the process of another fi rm. This is hard to do, but if you\ncan get VCs to approve a fi nancing around the same time, you’re in a\nmuch stronger position than if you have one term sheet in hand that\nyou are trying to use to generate additional term sheets.\nOnce you’ve received a term sheet from a VC, you can use this\nto motivate action from other VCs, but you have to walk a fi ne\nline between oversharing and being too secretive. We prefer when"}
{"page": 175, "text": "Negotiation Tactics 159\nentrepreneurs are up front, tell us that they have other interests,\nand let us know where in the process they are. We never ask to\nsee other term sheets, and we’d recommend that you don’t ever\nshow your actual term sheets to other investors. More important,\nyou should never disclose whom you are talking to, as one of the\nfirst emails most interested VCs will send after hearing about other\nVCs who are interested in a deal is something like “Hey, I hear you\nare interested in investing in X—want to share notes?” As a result,\nyou probably no longer have a competitive situation between the\ntwo VCs, as they will now talk about your deal and in many cases\ntalk about teaming up. The exception, of course, is when you want\nthem to team up and join together in a syndicate.\nAt the end of the day, if you have multiple term sheets, most of\nthe deal terms will collapse into the same range (usually entrepreneur\nfavorable), and the only real things you’ll be negotiating are valuation\nand board control. You can signal quite effectively what your other\noptions might be. Whatever you do, don’t sign a term sheet and then\npull a Brett Favre and change your mind the next day. The startup\necosystem is small, and word travels fast. Reputation is important.\nAnother strategy that can help you build leverage is to anchor\non certain terms. Anchoring means to pick a few points, state clearly\nwhat you want, and then stick to your guns. If you anchor on positions\nthat are reasonable while still having a little flexibility to give in the\nnegotiation, you will likely get close to what you want as long as you\nare willing to trade away other points that aren’t as important to you.\nAlthough you should try to pace the negotiation, you should do\nthis only after the VC has offered up the first term sheet. Never provide\na term sheet to a VC, especially with a price attached, since if you do\nyou’ve just capped what you can expect to get in the deal. You are always\nin a stronger position to react to what the VC offers, especially when you\nhave multiple options. However, once you’ve gotten a term sheet,\nyou should work hard to control the pace of the ensuing negotiation.\nAs with any type of negotiation, it helps to feed the ego of your\npartner. Figure out what the other side wants to hear and try to\nplease them. People tend to reciprocate niceties. For example, if you\nare dealing with technocrats, engage them in depth on some of the\ndeal points, even if the points don’t matter to you, in order to make\nthem happy and help them feel like you are playing their game.\nWhen you are leading the negotiation, we highly recommend\nthat you have a strategy about the order in which you will address"}
{"page": 176, "text": "160 Venture Deals\nthe points. Your options are to address them either in the order that\nthey are laid out in the term sheet or in some other random order of\nyour choosing. In general, once you are a skilled negotiator, going\nin order is more effective, as you won’t reveal which points matter\nmost to you. Often, experienced negotiators will try to get agree-\nment on a point-by-point basis in order to prevent the other party\nfrom looking holistically at the process and determining whether a\nfair deal is being achieved. This strategy really works only if you have\na lot of experience, and it can really backfi re on you if the other party\nis more experienced and takes control of the discussion. Instead of\nbeing on the giving end of a divide-and-conquer strategy, you’ll be\non the receiving end of death by a thousand cuts.\nUnless you are a very experienced negotiator, we suggest an order\nwhere you start with some important points that you think you can\nget to yes quickly. This way, both parties will feel good that they are\nmaking progress toward a deal. Maybe it’s liquidation preferences\nor the stock option plan allocation. Then dive into the minutiae.\nValuation is probably the last subject to address, as you’ll most likely\nget closure on other terms but have a couple of different rounds of\ndiscussion on valuation. It is completely normal for some terms to\ndrag out longer than others.\nThings Not to Do\nThere are a few things that you’ll never want to do when negotiat-\ning a fi nancing for your company. As we stated earlier, don’t present\nyour term sheet to a VC. In addition to signaling inexperience, you\nget no benefi t by playing your hand fi rst since you have no idea what\nthe VC will offer you. The likely result is either you’ll end up starting\nin a worse place than the VC would have offered, or you’ll put silly\nterms out there that will make you look like a rookie. If your poten-\ntial funding partner tells you to propose the terms, be wary, as it’s an\nindication that you are talking to either someone who isn’t a profes-\nsional VC or someone who is professionally lazy.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nYou should never make an offer fi rst. There’s no reason to, unless you have\nanother concrete one on the table. Why run the risk of aiming too low?"}
{"page": 177, "text": "Negotiation Tactics 161\nNext, make sure you know when to talk and when to listen. If you\nremember nothing else about this section, remember this: you can’t\nlose a deal point if you don’t open your mouth. Listening gives you\nfurther information about the other party, including what advan-\ntages you have over them (e.g., do they have a Little League baseball\ngame to coach in an hour?) and which negotiation styles they are\nmost comfortable with.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nAs the old cliché goes, there’s a reason you have two ears and one mouth. When\nyou are negotiating, try to listen more than you talk, especially at the beginning\nof the negotiation.\nIf the other party is controlling the negotiation, don’t address\ndeal points in order of the legal paper. This is true of all negotiations,\nnot just fi nancings. If you allow a person to address each point and\ntry to get to closure before moving on to the next point, you will lose\nsight of the deal as a whole. While you might feel that the resolution\non each point is reasonable, when you refl ect on the entire deal you\nmay be unhappy. If a party forces you into this mode, don’t concede\npoints. Listen and let the other party know that you’ll consider their\nposition after you hear all of their comments to the document. Many\nlawyers are trained to do exactly this—to kill you softly point by point.\nA lot of people rely on the same arguments over and over again\nwhen negotiating. People who negotiate regularly, including many\nVCs and lawyers, try to convince the other side to acquiesce by stat-\ning, “That’s the way it is because it’s market.” We love hearing the\nmarket argument because then we know that our negotiating part-\nner is a weak negotiator. Saying that “it’s market” is like your parents\ntelling you, “Because I said so,” and you responding, “But everyone’s\ndoing it.” These are elementary negotiating tactics that should have\nended around the time you left for college.\nIn the world of fi nancings, you’ll hear this all the time. Rather\nthan getting frustrated, recognize that it’s not a compelling argu-\nment since the concept of market terms isn’t the sole justifi cation for\na negotiation position. Instead, probe on why the market condition\napplies to you. In many cases, the other party won’t be able to justify\nit and, if they can’t make the argument, you’ll immediately have the\nhigher ground."}
{"page": 178, "text": "162 Venture Deals\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nUnderstanding market terms and whether they apply to your situation is impor-\ntant. You can quickly get context on this by talking to other entrepreneurs in\nsimilar positions. Remember, you do only a few of these deals in your lifetime,\nand your VC does them for a living. Understand what market really is, and you’ll\nbe able to respond to an assertion that something is market with fact rather than\nwith emotion.\nFinally, never assume that the other side has the same ethical\ncode as you. This isn’t a comment against VCs or lawyers; rather, it’s\na comment about life and pertains to every type of negotiation you’ll\nfi nd yourself involved in. Everyone has a different acceptable ethical\ncode, and it can change depending on the context of the negotia-\ntions. For instance, if you were to lie about the current state of a key\ncustomer to a prospective VC and it was discovered before the deal\nclosed, you’d most likely fi nd your deal blown up. Or perhaps the\ndeal would close, but you’d be fi red afterward, and it’s likely that\nsome of your peers would hear about it. As a result, both parties\n(VC and entrepreneur) have solid motivation to behave in an ethi-\ncal way during a fi nancing. Note that this is directly in contrast to\nmost behavior, at least between lawyers, in a litigation context where\nlies and half-truths are an acceptable part of that game. Regardless\nof the specifi c negotiation context, make sure you know the ethical\ncode of the party you are negotiating against.\nGreat Lawyers versus Bad Lawyers versus No Lawyers\nRegardless of how much you think you know or how much you’ve\nread, hire a great lawyer. In many cases you will be the least expe-\nrienced person around the negotiating table. VCs negotiate for a\nliving, and a great lawyer on your side will help balance things out.\nWhen choosing a lawyer, make sure she not only understands the\ndeal mechanics, but also has a style that you like working with and\nthat you are comfortable sitting alongside of. This last point can’t be\noverstated—your lawyer is a refl ection of you, and if you choose a\nlawyer who is inexperienced, is ineffective, or behaves inconsistently,\nit will refl ect poorly on you and decrease your negotiating credibility.\nSo choose a great lawyer, but make sure you know what g reat\nmeans.

Don’t limit your exploration to billing rates, respon-\nsiveness, and intellect, but also check style and how contentious nego-\ntiations were resolved. Furthermore, it’s completely acceptable to\nask your VC before and after the funding what the VC’s thoughts are\nabout your lawyer.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nChoosing a great lawyer doesn’t mean hiring an expensive lawyer from a fi rm\nthat your VC knows or recommends. Often for startups, going to a top-tier law\nfi rm means dealing with a second-tier or very junior lawyer, not well supervised,\nwith high billing rates. You can hire a smaller fi rm with lower rates and partner\nattention just as well; but be sure to do your homework on them, make sure\nthey’re experienced in dealing with venture fi nancings, and get references—\neven from VCs they’ve negotiated against in the past.\nCan You Make a Bad Deal Better?\nLet’s say you screw up and negotiate a bad deal. You had only one\nterm sheet, the VC was a combination bully and technocrat, and you\nare now stuck with deal terms that you don’t love. Should you spend\nall of your time being depressed? Nope, there are plenty of ways to\nfi x things after the fact that most entrepreneurs never think about.\nFirst of all, until an exit—either an acquisition or an IPO—many\nof the terms don’t matter much. But, more importantly, if you plan\nto raise another round led by a new investor, you have a potential\nally at the time to clean up the things you negotiated poorly in the\nfi rst investment. The new VC will be motivated to make sure you and\nyour team are happy (assuming the company is performing), and if\nyou talk to your new potential fi nancing partner about issues that are\ntroubling you, in many cases the new VC will concentrate on trying\nto bring these back into balance in the new fi nancing.\nIn the case where a new VC doesn’t lead the next round, you still\nhave the option of sitting down with your current VCs after you’ve\nhad some run time together (again, assuming success). We’ve been\ninvolved in numerous cases in which these were very constructive\nconversations that resulted in entrepreneur-friendly modifi cations\nto a deal."}
{"page": 180, "text": "164 Venture Deals\nFinally, you can wait until the exit and deal with your issues then.\nMost acquisition negotiations include a heavy focus on retention\ndynamics for the management team going forward, and there are\noften cases of reallocating some of the proceeds from the investors\nto management. The style of your VCs will impact how this plays out.\nIf they are playing a single-round game with the negotiation and\nthey don’t really care what happens after the deal closes, they will be\ninfl exible. However, if they want to be in a position to invest with you\nagain in the future, they’ll take a top-down view of the situation and\nbe willing to work through modifi cations to the deal terms to reallo-\ncate some consideration to management and employees, especially\nin a retention situation for the acquirer.\nRecognize, however, that this dynamic cuts both ways—many\nacquirers take the approach that they want to recut the economics\nin favor of the entrepreneur. Remember that as an entrepreneur you\nsigned up for the deal you currently have with your investors and you\nhave a corresponding responsibility to them. If you end up playing\na single-round game with your investors where you team up with the\nacquirer, you run the risk of blowing up both the acquisition and\nyour relationship with your investors. So, be thoughtful, fair, and\nopen with your investors around the incentives and dynamics.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nHaving an open and collaborative approach with your VC in the context of an\nacquisition may sound a bit like a game of chicken—but it can work. Being\nclear with your investors about what is important to you and your team early in\nthe negotiation can help set a tone where you and your investors are working\ntogether to reach the right deal structure, especially when the acquirer is trying\nto drive a wedge between you and those investors. A negotiation in a state of\nplenty is much easier than a negotiation in a state of scarcity.\nIn our experience, openness in these situations of both the entre-\npreneur and the VC generally results in much better outcomes. It’s\nhard enough to engage in a negotiation, let alone one in which there\nare multiple parties in a negotiation at cross-purposes (e.g., acquirer,\nentrepreneur, and VC). We always encourage entrepreneurs and\ntheir VC backers to keep focused on doing what is right for all share-\nholders in the context of whatever is being offered, and as a result to\ncontinue to constructively work through any issues, especially if one\nparty is uncomfortable with where they previously ended up."}

If they sign an NDA regarding\nany company, they’d likely run afoul of it if they ended up funding a\ncompany that you consider a competitor. An NDA will also prevent\na VC from talking to other VCs about your company, even ones who\nmight be good co-investors for your financing.\nHowever, don’t be too scared about approaching a reputable VC\nwith your idea without an NDA. The VC industry is small and wouldn’t\nlast long if VCs spoke out of turn sharing people’s knowledge with\none another. And don’t think that VCs will steal your idea and start a\ncompany, as reputational constraints as well as limits on a VC’s time\nwill eliminate this risk in most cases. Though you might occasionally\nrun into a bad actor, do your homework and you’ll generally be fine.\nDon’t Email Carpet Bomb VCs\nYou might not know VCs personally, but the way to get to know them\nis not by buying a mailing list and sending personalized spam. And\nit’s not good to hire an investment adviser who will do the same. VCs\nknow when they are getting a personal pitch versus spam, and we\ndon’t know any VCs who react well to spam.\nSpamming looks lazy. If you didn’t take the time to really think\nabout who would be a good funding partner, what does that say\nabout how you run the rest of the business? If you want to contact\nus, just email us, but make it personal to us. Be thoughtful, specific,\nand strategic with your first communication attempt. You don’t get a\nsecond chance to make a first impression, and you are being judged\nfor much more than your idea and your bio.\nNo Often Means No\nWhile most VCs appreciate persistence, when they say they aren’t\ninterested, they usually mean it. We aren’t asking you to try again."}

If you have a\nrelationship with the VC (e.g., it’s not a cold request), ask why the answer is no.\nIf the response to that question is something about the VC fi rm rather than your\ncompany (e.g., “You’re too small for us,” or “One of our portfolio companies\nis too competitive”), then you may ask for a referral to another fi rm that might\nbe a better fi t.

However, there\nare cases where this isn’t useful—to you.\nDon’t Be a Solo Founder\nOutside of some isolated examples, most entrepreneurs will have\nlittle chance of raising money unless they have a team. A team can\nbe a team of two, but the solo entrepreneur raising money can be a\nred flag.\nFirst, no single person can do everything. We’ve never met any-\none who can do absolutely everything from product vision to execut-\ning on a plan, engineering development, marketing, sales, opera-\ntions, and all the other random stuff starting a company entails.\nThere are just too many mission-critical tasks in getting a successful\ncompany launched. You will be much happier if you have a partner\nto back you up.\nSecond, it’s not a good sign if you can’t get others excited about\nyour plan. It’s hard enough to get VCs to write checks to fund your\ncompany; if you can’t find other team members with the same pas-\nsion and beliefs that you have, this is a warning sign to anyone who\nmight want to fund your company.\nFinally, if you don’t have a team, what is the VC investing in?\nOften, the team executing the idea is more important than the idea\nitself. Most VCs will tell you that they’ve made money on grade B\nideas with grade A teams but that many A ideas were left in the dust-\nbin due to a substandard team.\nThe one exception would be a repeat entrepreneur. If the ven-\nture fund has had a good experience with an entrepreneur before\nand believes they can build a solid team post funding, then the per-\nson has a chance to get funded as a solo entrepreneur.\nDon’t Overemphasize Patents\nDon’t rely on patents. We see a lot of entrepreneurs basically hinge\ntheir entire company’s worth on their patent strategy. If you are in\nbiotech, hardware, or medical devices, this might be entirely appro-\npriate.

This is especially true when\nyou factor in the different stages that your company will evolve\nthrough over its lifetime. While this book is primarily focused on\nearly-stage financings, and many of the issues apply to all stages,\nthere are some key differences. This chapter touches on a few of the\nimportant ones.\nSeed Deals\nWhile seed deals have the lowest legal costs and usually involve the\nleast contentious negotiations, they often allow for the most poten-\ntial mistakes. Given how important precedent is in future financings,\nif you reach a bad outcome on a specific term, you might be stuck\nwith it for the life of your company. Ironically, we’ve seen more cases\nwhere the entrepreneur got what at the time seemed to be too good\nof a deal but ultimately ended up being bad for them.\nWhat’s wrong with getting great terms? If you can’t back them\nup with performance when you raise your next round, you may find\nyourself in a difficult position with your original investor. For exam-\nple, assume you are successful getting a valuation that is significantly\nahead of where your business currently is. If your next round isn’t\nat a higher valuation, you are going to be diluting your original\nshareholders—the investors who took a big risk to fund you during\nthe seed stage. Either you’ll have to make them whole or, worse,\nthey’ll vote to block the new financing. This is especially true in cases\n171"}
{"page": 187, "text": "172 Venture Deals\nwith unsophisticated seed investors who were expecting that, no\nmatter what, the next round price would be higher.\nThe number and type of investors you get involved in your early\nrounds may also have a long-term impact on this. Assume that you\nare raising a $1 million seed financing and that you’ve been success-\nful creating interest in your company. You have several offers—one\nfrom a venture capitalist (VC) willing to invest $750,000 alongside\nan AngelList syndicate that has committed the remaining $250,000.\nThe second is from five different venture capital firms, including two\nvery large ones, each of whom has committed to invest 20% of the\nround. Which is likely better for you long term?\nIn our experience, the first deal is the better one. In this situa-\ntion, you have a clear lead investor who will be committed to your\ncompany and work hard for you. You also have some additional\nangels, ideally including some well-networked and high-profile ones\nwho can help you. In the second scenario, which is often called a\nparty round, you don’t have a clear lead investor. Instead, each of the\nVCs has, in their mind, bought an option on your next financing.\nIn the worst case, no one really pays much attention to you until\nyou have spent most of the $1 million, at which point they evaluate\nwhether or not you’ve made progress as they consider investing in\nthe next round. Think of this as a complicated version of doubles\ntennis where the shot from your opponent goes right down the mid-\ndle of the court while you and your partner each shout out “yours.”\nEarly Stage\nAs with seed deals, precedent is important in early-stage deals. In our\nexperience, the terms you get in your first VC-led round will carry\nover to all future financings. One item that can haunt you forever is\nthe liquidation preference. While it may not seem like a big deal to\nagree to a participating preferred feature given that most early-stage\nrounds aren’t large dollar amounts, if you plan to raise larger rounds\none day, these participation features can drastically reduce return\ncharacteristics for the common stockholders.\nAnother term to pay extra attention to at the early stage is the\nprotective provisions. You will want to try to collapse the protective\nprovisions so that all preferred stockholders, regardless of series, vote\ntogether on them. If by your second round of financing you have two\nseparate votes, one by each class, for the protective provisions, you"}
{"page": 188, "text": "Issues at Different Financing Stages 173\nare most likely stuck with a structure that will give each series of stock\na separate vote and thus separate blocking rights. This can be a real\npain to manage when you have multiple lead investors in multiple\nrounds that each have their own motivations to deal with.\nThis dynamic is infl uenced by the number of different rounds\nyou expect to raise. If you are likely to raise only two or three rounds,\nthe synchronization between rounds is less important. But if you\nexpect you will raise more than three rounds, getting as many of the\nterms aligned across all classes of preferred will make your life a lot\nsimpler, and better, since you won’t have endless multiparty negotia-\ntions around every action that impact your preferred stockholders.\nRecognize, however, that many entrepreneurs are overly optimistic\nabout how many funding rounds they will need.\nMid and Late Stages\nIn your later rounds, board composition and voting control starts to\ncome into play in a signifi cant way. The voting control issues in the\nearly-stage deals are amplifi ed as you wrestle with how to keep con-\ntrol of your board when each lead investor per round wants a board\nseat. Either you can increase your board size to seven, nine, or more\npeople (which usually effectively kills a well-functioning board) or,\nmore likely, the board will be dominated by investors. If your inves-\ntors are well behaved, this might not be a problem, but you’ll still be\nserving a lot of food at board meetings.\nThere isn’t necessarily a good answer here. Unless you have mas-\nsive negotiating power in a super-hot company, you are likely to give\na board seat to each lead investor in each round. If you raise subse-\nquent rounds, unless you’ve worked hard to manage this early, your\nboard will likely expand and in many cases the founders will lose\ncontrol of the board.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nThere are ways to mitigate issues of board and voting control, such as placing\na cap (early on) on the number or percentage of directors who can be VCs as\nopposed to independent directors, preemptively offering observer rights to any\ndirector who is dethroned, or establishing an executive committee of the board\nthat can meet whenever and wherever you’d like without everyone else around\nthe table."}
{"page": 189, "text": "174 Venture Deals\nValuation also starts to be a confounding factor in later-stage\nrounds. While the natural instinct of any entrepreneur is to maxi-\nmize valuation at each financing stage, the trade-off of a clean deal\nwith a lower valuation against a complicated deal, with excessive con-\ntrol and economic characteristics (referred to as structure), can often\nmake what seems like a great deal for the entrepreneur at the time\nbecome a nightmare in the future.\nMuch like issues that we’ve seen in seed deals, there have been\nsome deals that have been too good and have forced the VCs to hold\nout for a huge exit price. The net effect was that by raising money at\nsuch a high valuation, the entrepreneurs forfeited the ability to sell\nthe company at a price they would have been happy with, because\nof the inherent valuation-creation desires of the VCs who paid such\na high price. We’ve seen deal terms that specifically either forbid\nsales below a certain value or provide for a guaranteed multiple on\na VC’s investment that juices up the latest round investors return at\nthe expense of the earlier investors, founders, and employees. The\nfascination with unicorns in the past few years has exacerbated this, as\nsophisticated investors demand more structure, resulting in signifi-\ncant outcome misalignment between early- and late-stage investors.\nAs we mentioned earlier in the book, when you get a term sheet from\nan early-stage VC, it is almost always the case that they have full approval\nof their firm to move forward with the investment. This is not necessar-\nily the case with later-stage investors, as they often have at least one more\napproval step, which often happens after the entire deal has been nego-\ntiated. We’ve seen multiple situations where this final approval didn’t\nhappen, and the deal died at the very end of the process.\nIn this case, you sign the term sheet, shut down discussions with all\nof the other investors you are talking to since you have signed a term\nsheet with a no-shop clause, and start down the process of diligence with\nyour prospective investor. Along the way, they inform you that they’ll\nneed approval from their investment committee and for some reason it\ndoesn’t happen. At this point you are stuck. You terminated your other\ninvestment options and now don’t have a valid term sheet any more.\nSometimes the investor will attempt to renegotiate the price or\nother terms knowing that they have all the leverage. We personally\nfind this deplorable, and it was one of the motivations for us to raise\nour Foundry Select fund, as we were tired of later-stage firms playing\ngames like this and wanted to be able to support our companies in\ntheir later stages."}

Hopefully, one day you’ll\nreceive one from a potential acquirer that will lead to fame, riches,\nand happiness. Or at least you’ll get a new business card on heavier\ncard stock.\nTypically, the first formal step by a company that wants to acquire\nyours is for it to issue a letter of intent. This sometimes delightful\nand usually nonbinding document (except for things like a no-\nshop agreement) is also known as an indication of inter est (IOI),\nmemorandum of understanding (MOU), and even occasionally a\nterm sheet.\nAs with our friend the term sheet, there are some terms that\nmatter a lot and others that don’t. Once again there are plenty of\nmysterious words that experienced deal makers always know how\nand where to sprinkle so that they can later say, “But X implies Y,”\noften resulting in much arguing between lawyers. We’ve had LOIs\nget done in a couple of hours and had others take several months\nto get signed. As with any negotiation, experience, knowledge, and\nunderstanding matter. The LOI negotiation is usually a first taste of\nthe actual negotiating style you will experience from the other party.\nThis negotiation will be the beginning of the end of your inde-\npendence as a company. Unlike a venture financing where everyone\ncan win by expanding the pie over time, you are now negotiating for\na fixed pie. Subsequently, the tone and stress around these negotia-\ntions are much tougher than a regular venture financing.\n175"}
{"page": 191, "text": "176 Venture Deals\nTo keep things straightforward, we are going to focus on explain-\ning the typical case of a two-party transaction between a buyer and\na seller, which we’ll refer to as an acquisition. As with many things in\nlife, there are often more complex transactions, including three or\nmore parties, but we’ll save that for a different book.\nBy the time the buyer presents the seller with an LOI, there have\nbeen meetings, discussions, dinners, expensive bottles of wine, lots\nof conference calls, and an occasional argument. However, the buyer\nand the seller are still courting so they tend to be on their best behav-\nior. The LOI is typically the first real negotiation and the true ice-\nbreaker for the relationship.\nIn ancient times, when the first LOI was presented, someone\ncrafted an introductory paragraph that started with something like\nthe following:\nDear CEO of Seller:\nWe have greatly enjoyed our conversations to date and are hon-\nored to present you with this letter of intent to acquire [Seller’s\nCompany]. We look forward to entering into serious discussions\nover the next several months and reaching an agreement to\nacquire your company. We’d like to thank you for entertaining\nour proposal, which follows:\nWhile every company has its own style, most LOIs begin with\nsome variation of this boilerplate paragraph. Of course, you’ll find—\nlater in the LOI—a qualifier that states that almost everything in the\nLOI is nonbinding, including the appearance of civility as part of the\nnegotiation.\nStructure of a Deal\nAs with financings, there are only a couple of things that really\nmatter—in this case price and structure. Since the first question\nanyone involved in a deal typically asks is “What is the price?,” we’ll\nstart there.\nUnlike a venture financing in which price is usually pretty\nstraightforward to understand, figuring out the price in an acquisi-\ntion can be more difficult. There is usually some number floated in\nearly discussions, but this isn’t really the actual price since there are a\nlot of factors that can (and generally will) impact the final price of a"}
{"page": 192, "text": "Letters of Intent—The Other Term Sheet 177\ndeal by the time the negotiations are finished and the deal is closed.\nIt’s usually a safe bet to assume that the easy-to-read number on the\nfirst page of the LOI is the best-case scenario purchase price. Follow-\ning is an example of what you might see in a typical LOI:\nPurchase Price/Consideration: $100 million of cash will be paid\nat closing, $15 million of which will be subject to the terms of\nthe escrow provisions described in paragraph 3 of this Letter\nof Intent. Working capital of at least $1 million shall be deliv-\nered at closing. Forty million dollars of cash will be subject to\nan earn-out and $10 million of cash will be part of a manage-\nment retention pool. Buyer will not assume outstanding options\nto purchase Company Common Stock, and any options to pur-\nchase shares of Company Common Stock not exercised prior\nto the Closing will be terminated as of the Closing. Warrants to\npurchase shares of Company capital stock not exercised prior to\nthe Closing will be terminated as of the Closing.\nBefore this paragraph was drafted, it’s likely that a number\naround $150 million was discussed as the purchase price. The first\nthing that jumps out is the reference to a $15 million escrow. The\nescrow (also known as a holdback) is money that the buyer is going\nto hang on to for some period of time to satisfy any issues that come\nup post financing that are not disclosed in the purchase agreement.\nIn some LOIs we’ve seen extensive details, wherein each provision\nof the escrow is spelled out, including the percentage of the hold-\nback, length of time, and carve-outs to the indemnity agreement.\nIn other cases, there is mention that “standard escrow and indem-\nnity terms shall apply.” We’ll discuss specific escrow language later\n(i.e., you’ll have to wait until “paragraph 3”), but it’s safe to say two\nthings: first, there is no such thing as standard language; and sec-\nond, whatever the escrow arrangement is, it will decrease the actual\npurchase price should any claim be brought under it. So, clearly,\nthe amount and terms of the escrow and indemnity provisions are\nvery important.\nNext is the reference to $1 million of working capital. While\nthis might not seem like a big number, it’s still $1 million. Many\nyoung companies end up with negative working capital at closing\n(working capital is current assets minus current liabilities) due to\ndebt, deferred revenue, warranty reserves, inventory carry costs,"}
{"page": 193, "text": "178 Venture Deals\nand expenses and fees associated with the deal. As a result, these\nworking capital adjustments directly decrease the purchase price if\nupon closing (or other predetermined date after the closing) the\nseller’s working capital is less than an agreed-upon amount. Assume\nthat unless the working capital threshold is a slam-dunk situation\nwhere the company has clearly complied with this requirement, the\ndetermination will be a battle that can have a real impact on the\npurchase price. In some cases, this can act in the seller’s favor to\nincrease the value of the deal if the seller has more working capital\non the balance sheet than the buyer requires, but only if the clause\naround working capital is bidirectional (it’s not in this example).\nFinally, it feels silly and gratuitous to us when a multibillion-dollar\ncompany asks for any working capital number above zero from\na startup.\nWhile earn-outs sound like a mechanism to increase price, in\nour experience, they usually are a tool that allows the acquirer to\nunderpay at time of closing and pay full value only if certain hur-\ndles are met in the future. In our example, the acquirer suggested\nthat it was willing to pay $150 million, but is really paying only\n$100 million with $40 million of the deal subject to an earn-out.\nWe’ll cover earn-outs separately since there are a lot of permuta-\ntions, especially if the seller is receiving stock instead of cash as its\nconsideration.\nIn our example, the buyer has explicitly carved out $10 million\nfor a management retention pool. This has become common since\nbuyers want to make sure that management has a clear and direct\nfuture financial incentive. In this case, it’s built into the purchase\nprice (e.g., $150 million). We’ve found that buyers tend to be split\nbetween building it into the purchase price and putting it on top\nof the purchase price. In either case, it is effectively part of the\ndeal consideration but is at risk since it’ll typically be paid out over\nseveral years to the members of management who continue their\nroles at the acquirer. If someone leaves, that portion of the man-\nagement retention pool tends to vanish into the same place socks\nlost in the dryer go. In addition, it’s a move on the part of the buyer\nto allocate some percentage of the purchase price away from the\nformal ownership (or capitalization table) of the company as a way\nof driving an early negotiating wedge between management and\nthe investors."}
{"page": 194, "text": "Letters of Intent—The Other Term Sheet 179\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nBy the time someone is offering you a lot of money to buy your company, you\nshould have good counsel or advisers or independent board members to help\nyou navigate the terms. The structure of the deal is very important. You should\nbe willing to stand behind your r epresentations and warrantees with a reason-\nable 12- to 18-month escrow at a minimum. If you can’t, you look like you’re\nhiding something. Management retention pool, working capital, and earn-outs\nare just negotiation points around the certainty and price of a deal.\nFinally, there are a bunch of words in our example about the buyer\nnot assuming stock options and warrants. We’ll explain this in more\ndetail later, but, like the working capital clause, it can impact the over-\nall value of the deal based on what people are expecting to receive.\nAsset Deal versus Stock Deal\nWhile price is usually the fi rst issue on every seller’s mind, structure\nshould be second. Lawyers talk about two types of deals, asset deals\nand stock deals, but there are numerous structural issues surround-\ning each type of deal. Let’s begin by discussing the basics of an asset\ndeal and a stock deal.\nIn general, all sellers want to do stock deals and all buyers want\nto do asset deals. Just to increase the confusion level, a stock deal\ncan be done for cash and an asset deal can be done for stock. Don’t\nconfuse the type of deal with the actual consideration received.\nSarcastic VCs on the seller side will refer to an asset deal as a\nsituation “when buying a company is not really buying a company.”\nBuyers will request this structure, with the idea that they will buy only\nthe particular assets that they want out of a company, leave certain\nliabilities (read: “warts”) behind, and live happily ever after. If you\nengage lawyers and accountants in this discussion, they’ll ramble on\nabout something regarding taxes, accounting, and liabilities, but our\nexperience is that most of the time the acquirer is just looking to\nbuy the crown jewels, explicitly limit its liabilities, and craft a simpler\ndeal for itself at the expense of the seller. We notice that asset deals\nare more popular in shaky economic times since acquirers are try-\ning to avoid creditor issues and successor liability. One saw relatively\nfew asset deals in the late 1990s, but in early 2000 asset deals became"}
{"page": 195, "text": "180 Venture Deals\nmuch more popular; yet by 2016 asset deals are once again rarely\nseen and only in distressed situations.\nWhile asset deals can work for a seller, the fundamental problem\nfor the seller is that the company hasn’t actually been sold! The assets\nhave left the company (and are now owned by the buyer), but there\nis still a shell corporation with contracts, liabilities, potential employ-\nees, and tax forms to file. Even if the company is relatively clean from\na corporate hygiene perspective, it may take several years (depend-\ning on tax, capital structure, and jurisdictional concerns) to wind\ndown the company. During this time, the officers and directors of\nthe company are still on the hook, and the company presumably has\nfew assets to operate the business (since they were sold to the buyer).\nIn the case of a stock deal, the acquirer is buying the entire com-\npany. Once the acquisition is closed, the seller’s company disappears\ninto the corporate structure of the buyer and there is nothing left,\nexcept possibly some T-shirts that found their way into the hands\nof spouses and the company sign that used to be on the door just\nbefore the deal closed. There is nothing to wind down, and the com-\npany is history.\nSo is an asset deal bad or is it just a hassle? It depends. It can be\nreally bad if the seller has multiple subsidiaries, numerous contracts,\nemployees with severance commitments, or disgruntled shareholders,\nor it is close to insolvency. In this case, the officers and directors may\nbe taking on fraudulent conveyance liability by consummating an asset\ndeal. It’s merely a hassle if the company is in relatively good shape, is\nvery small, or has few shareholders to consider. Of course, if any of\nthese things are true, then the obvious rhetorical question is, “Why\ndoesn’t the acquirer just buy the whole company via a stock deal?”\nIn our experience, we see stock deals the vast majority of the\ntime. Often, the first draft of the LOI is an asset deal, but it’s often\nthe first point raised by sophisticated sellers and they are often suc-\ncessful in ending up with a stock deal except in extreme circum-\nstances when the company is in dire straits. Many buyers go down a\npath to discuss all the protection they get from an asset deal. This is\ngenerally nonsense since a stock deal can be configured to provide\nfunctionally equivalent protection for the buyer with a lot less hassle\nfor the seller. In addition, asset deals are no longer the protection\nthey used to be with regard to successor liability in a transaction,\nsince courts are much more eager to find a company that purchases\nsubstantial assets of another company to be a so-called successor in\ninterest with respect to liabilities of the seller."}
{"page": 196, "text": "Letters of Intent—The Other Term Sheet 181\nThe structure of the deal is also tied closely to the tax issues\nsurrounding a deal. Once you start trying to optimize for structure\nand taxes, you end up defi ning the type of consideration (stock or\ncash) the seller can receive. It can get complicated very quickly,\nand pretty soon you can feel like you are climbing up a staircase\nin an Escher drawing. We’ll dig into tax and consideration in a bit;\njust realize that they are all linked together and usually ultimately\nimpact price, which is—after all—what the seller usually cares most\nabout.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nIf your company is in bad shape, you will probably have no choice but to do an\nasset sale and deal with the liabilities and associated winding down of the entity\nyourself. You should be prepared for this situation and constantly be calculating\nthe expense and hassle of an asset deal to understand what kind of alternatives\nyou’re willing to consider.\nForm of Consideration\nImagine the following conversation between an entrepreneur and\na VC:\nEntrepreneur: “I just received an offer for the company for $15 mil-\nlion from Company X.”\nVC: “Awesome. Who’s Company X? I’ve never heard of them.”\nEntrepreneur: “It’s a private company funded by Venture Firm Y.”\nVC: “Cool—$15 million. Is it a cash deal?”\nEntrepreneur: “No, it’s all stock.”\nVC: “Hmmm—are you getting preferred or common stock?”\nEntrepreneur: “Common stock.

If our friend calls his friendly neighborhood financial\nappraiser to do a valuation analysis, he’ll find out the $15 million he\nthinks he is getting is actually valued at a lot less (probably good for\ntax purposes, not so good for buying beer, sports cars, and second\nhouses).\nThe form of consideration matters a lot. Cash is—well—king.\nEverything else is something less. And it can be a lot less. Did you hear\nthe one where the acquirer offered “free software products” up to a\ncertain amount in exchange for the company’s assets? Gee, er, thanks.\nObviously, cash is easy to understand and to value. Stock can be\nmore complicated. If it’s stock in a private company, understanding\nthe existing capital structure is a critical first step to understanding\nwhat you are getting. If it’s stock in a public company, you’ll want\nto ask a variety of questions, including whether the stock is freely\ntradable, registered, or subject to a lockup agreement. If it’s freely\ntradable, will you be considered an insider after the transaction and\nhave any selling restrictions? If it’s not freely tradable, what kind of\nregistration rights will you have? It can get messy quickly, especially if\nyou try to optimize for tax (there’s that tax thing again).\nIt’s important to realize that the value of your company and the\nprice you are getting paid may not be the same. Don’t let yourself get\nlocked into a price early in the negotiation until you understand the\nform of consideration you are receiving.\nAssumption of Stock Options\nAfter considering price and structure, it is time to discuss other\nmajor deal points generally found in an LOI. One item to note here:\nabsence of these terms in your particular LOI may not be a good\nthing, as in our experience detailed LOIs are better than vague ones\n(but be careful not to overlawyer the LOI). Specifically, this is the\ncase because during the LOI discussions most of the negotiating is\nbetween the business principals of the deal, not their lawyers, who\nwill become the main deal drivers after the signing of the term sheet.\nOur experience is that leaving material business points to the law-\nyers will slow down the process, increase deal costs, and cause much\nunneeded pain and angst. Our suggestion would be to always have"}

Over the past five years, the practice of what happens to\nstock options in a merger has changed greatly. Let’s start by discuss-\ning some history.\nPrior to 2010 nearly all well-drafted option plans provided for\nautomatic assumption of the plan. If a company was acquired, the\nplan would automatically be assigned to and assumed by the acquirer;\notherwise, all the unvested options would immediately vest and the\nemployees would cash out immediately. This approach provided an\nincentive to all parties to have the options assumed. Since nothing is\nfree in this world, the costs to assume the plan (not the legal costs,\nbut the total consideration owed to employees under the plan) was\nnetted against the purchase price. Simply stated, if the assumed plan\nconverted to options of the acquirer worth $10 million, then $10 mil-\nlion would come off the purchase price.\nThe theory behind this approach was to protect the employees\nof the company who are not at the bargaining table during an acqui-\nsition. In the last decade, acquirers began to substitute forms of con-\nsideration they viewed as comparable rather than simply assuming\nthe option plan. Instead of options, they might create a cash-backed\nincentive plan for employees. Or, they’d choose restricted stock\nunits (RSUs) instead of options because of arcane tax laws that force\ncompanies to expense options. Regardless, acquirers wanted flex-\nibility to incentivize their new employees rather than being forced\ninto a specific approach.\nIn some cases, acquirers did not assume the plan, sometimes\ndue to tax laws, and all of the employee’s options vested. While\nthat sounds employee friendly (it is), it can cause significant fric-\ntion among employees. For instance, consider an employee who had\nbeen at the company for three years and was mostly vested. This\nemployee saw relatively little vesting (one year) in contrast to the\nemployee who joined the company a month earlier and now got\nthree years and 11 months of vesting.\nAs time passed, the option plans evolved. Today, the general\napproach is that options plans allow for the assumption or substi-\ntution of similar plans, but explicitly state that the acquirer has no"}
{"page": 199, "text": "184 Venture Deals\nobligation to do much at all. The board of the acquired company\ncan vote to accelerate the options if it chooses, but are no longer\nguaranteed protections for employees with stock options. Usually,\nthis doesn’t matter, as the parties (both the target and the buyer,\nalong with their respective boards of directors) do the right thing by\nemployees. But this is not always the case.\nWe’ve seen situations where the buyer refused to assume the option\nplan or provide any meaningful substitute consideration. In this case,\nthe employees with options get hosed and those who are vested get all\nthe consideration. In these cases, the acquirer only cares about tech-\nnology, the management team, and long-serving employees.\nWe’ve seen other cases where the acquirer offered to either\nassume or substitute (again with RSUs) the option plan, but then\nasked key members of the team to “revest” their options. Revesting\nmeans that even if an employee has vested a certain amount of their\noptions, they have to stick around for a predetermined period of\ntime to vest them again. For example, presume that the acquirer\nwants everyone to revest all of their options over two years. It doesn’t\nmatter how many options you’ve already vested—you now start the\nvesting clock over. Typically, the acquirer will do something more\ncomplicated, like give everyone vesting credit for up to two years\nbut then revest any remaining options over four years. This costs the\nacquirer nothing but has a meaningful impact on potential consider-\nation for employees that is dependent on how long they stay.\nAnother issue impacting stock options is whether the acquisition is\nin cash, public company stock, or private company stock. We’re going\nto ignore tax considerations for the moment (although you shouldn’t\nignore them in a real-world acquisition). If I’m an employee of a seller,\nI’m going to value cash differently from public stock (restricted or\nunrestricted) and public stock options differently from private stock\n(or options). If the buyer is public or is paying cash, the calculation\nis straightforward and can be easily explained to the employee. If the\nbuyer is private, this becomes much more challenging and is some-\nthing that management and the representatives of the seller who are\nstructuring the transaction should think through carefully.\nThe basis of stock options (also known as the strike price or barter\nelement)—and who pays for it—should also be considered as it\nreduces the value of the stock options. Specifically, if the value of\na share of stock in a transaction is $1 and the basis of the stock\noption is $0.40, the actual value of the stock option at the time of"}
{"page": 200, "text": "Letters of Intent—The Other Term Sheet 185\nthe transaction is $0.60. Many sellers forget to try to recapture the\nvalue of the barter element in the purchase price and allow the total\npurchase price to be the gross value of the stock options (vested and\nunvested) rather than getting incremental credit on the purchase\nprice for the barter element.\nLet’s assume you have a $100 million cash transaction with $10\nmillion going to option holders, 50% of which are vested and 50% are\nunvested. Assume for simplicity that the buyer is assuming unvested\noptions but including them in the total purchase price (the $100 mil-\nlion) and that the total barter element of the vested stock is $1 million\nand the barter element of the unvested stock is $3 million. The vested\nstock has a value of $4 million ($5 million value minus $1 million\nbarter element) and the unvested stock has a value of $2 million ($5\nmillion value minus $3 million barter element). So the option holders\nare going to net only $6 million total. Often, the seller will catch the\nvested stock amount (e.g., vested options will account for $4 million\nof the $100 million), but the full $5 million will be allocated to the\nunvested options (instead of the actual value/cost to the buyer of $2\nmillion). This is a material difference (e.g., the difference between\n$91 million going to the non–option holders versus $94 million).\nOf course, all of this assumes that the stock options are in the\nmoney. If the purchase price of the transaction puts the options out\nof the money (e.g., the purchase price is below the liquidation pref-\nerence), all of this is irrelevant since the options are worthless.\nWhile this is dense stuff, it’s important to address it during the\nLOI phase to make sure you are doing the right thing in the context\nof the deal for both your employees and your investors. It’s easy to\npunt this until later in the process, only to fi nd that you are now\nstuck in the middle of a multiparty negotiation between the buyer,\nyour investors, and your employees with no obvious way to satisfy\neveryone. Also, by this time you’ve stopped negotiations with other\nsuitors and have no real negotiation leverage.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nIn most cases, your employees got your company to where it is. Do not sell them\nshort in an exit, whether or not there is an earn-out that compels you to keep\nthem happy. Your reputation as an entrepreneur is at stake here, plus you want\nto do the right thing."}
{"page": 201, "text": "186 Venture Deals\nRepresentations, Warranties, and Indemnification\nEvery LOI will have some mention of representations and warranties,\nalso called “reps and warranties” or just “reps” by those in the know.\nThe reps and warranties are the facts and assurances about the busi-\nness that one party gives the other. In most LOIs, the language in\nthis paragraph is light in substance, but this section can have a pro-\nfound effect on the deal and consume a ridiculous amount of legal\ntime during the negotiation of the definitive agreement.\nThe first thing to note is who is making the representations.\nDoes it say the selling company will be making the reps, or does it\nsay the selling company and its shareholders are on the hook? Or,\nmore typically, is it silent as to who exactly is stepping up to the plate?\nGiven that many shareholders (including VCs and individuals who\nhold stock in the selling company) are unwilling or unable to repre-\nsent and warrant to the seller’s situation, it’s important to resolve in\nthe LOI who is actually making the reps. Optimally you can get this\nsolved before the lawyers start fighting over this, since most buyers\nwill eventually accept that the company, instead of the underlying\nshareholders in the company, is making the reps.\nAll LOIs will have something regarding indemnification in the\nevent that one of the reps or warranties is breached. Considering\nhow important this provision is to the seller in an acquisition, it’s\noften the case that the buyer will try to sneak past the following lan-\nguage in the LOI.\nThe Company shall make standard representations and warran-\nties and provide standard indemnification to Acquirer.\nThis is code for:\nWe are really going to negotiate hard on the indemnification\nterms, but don’t want to tell you at this stage so that you’ll sign\nthe LOI and become committed to doing the deal. Really—trust\nus—our deal guys and lawyers are nice and cuddly.\nDepending on the situation of the seller (perhaps the seller is in\na position whereby it wants to get the buyer committed more than\nvice versa and is willing to take its chances with the lawyers arguing),\nwe’d suggest that you at least sketch out what the indemnification"}
{"page": 202, "text": "Letters of Intent—The Other Term Sheet 187\nwill look like. Again, once the lawyers get involved, arguments like\n“It’s market and it’s nonnegotiable” or “I get this on all of my deals”\nget bantered about endlessly.\nThe buyer usually makes some reps as well, but since it is paying\nfor the seller, these are typically pretty lightweight unless the buyer is\npaying in private company stock. If you are a seller and you are get-\nting private stock from the buyer, a completely logical starting point\nis to make all the reps and warranties reciprocal.\nWhile many of these reps and warranties may look similar to the\nones in your venture fi nancing documents, VCs almost never sue\ncompanies they invest in. However, in acquisitions the reps and war-\nranties often come into play after the merger is completed, so you\nshould understand them and take them seriously.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nAs long as most of your reps and warranties are qualifi ed by a phrase like “to\nthe extent currently known . . . ,” you should have no problem signing them.\nArguing against them is a big red fl ag to investors or buyers.\nEscrow\nThe escrow is another hotly negotiated term that often is left ambig-\nuous in the LOI. The escrow (also known as a holdback) is money\nthat the buyer is going to hang on to for some period of time to sat-\nisfy any issue that comes up post acquisition that is not disclosed in\nthe purchase agreement.\nIn some LOIs we’ve seen extensive details—with each provision\nof the escrow agreement spelled out—including the percentage\nof the holdbacks, length of time, and carve-outs to the indemnity\nagreement. In other cases, there is simply a declaration that “stan-\ndard escrow and indemnity terms shall apply.” Since there really isn’t\nany such thing as a standard term, this is another buyer-centric trap\nfor deferring what can become a brutal negotiation in the post-LOI\nstage. Whatever the escrow arrangement is, it will decrease the actual\npurchase price should any claim be brought under it, so the terms of\nthe agreement can be very important since they directly impact the\nvalue that the seller receives."}
{"page": 203, "text": "188 Venture Deals\nIn our experience over hundreds of acquisitions, an escrow is\ntypically set up as the sole remedy for breaches of the reps and\nwarranties, with a few exceptions, known as carve-outs. Normally\nbetween 10% and 20% of the aggregate purchase price is set aside\nfor between 12 and 24 months to cure any breaches of the reps.\nWhile this is usually where the escrow terms end up (and are usu-\nally described as the e scrow caps ), it can take a herculean effort to\nget there. Buyers often try to overreach, especially if the parameters\nare not defi ned in the LOI, by asking for things such as uncapped\nindemnity if anything goes wrong, personal liability of company\nexecutives and major shareholders, and even the ability to capture\nmore value than the deal is worth.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nBuyers overreaching on the escrow terms are silly, especially if you have a\nwell-run business with audited fi nancials and outside directors. Remember,\nwhen a public company gets acquired, its reps and warranties usually expire\nat the closing!\nThe carve-outs to the escrow caps typically include fraud, capi-\ntalization, and taxes. Often, especially due to the risk of attack by\npatent trolls, a buyer will press for intellectual property ownership to\nbe carved out. We’ve also started to see liabilities resulting from lack\nof 409A compliance be carved out in escrow agreements under the\nargument that 409A is equivalent to taxes. In all cases, the maximum\nof the carve-out should be the aggregate deal value, as the seller\nshouldn’t have to come up with more than it was paid in the deal to\nsatisfy an escrow claim.\nA lot of buyers will say something like “Well, I can’t fi gure the\nspecifi cs out until I do more due diligence.” We say baloney to that\nas we’ve yet to meet a buyer that was unable to put an initial escrow\nproposal, with some detail and caps defi ned, in the LOI. This lan-\nguage is still subject to due diligence but is harder to retrade after it\nhas been agreed to since something of substance has to emerge for\nthere to be a legitimate discussion about it.\nFinally, the form of consideration of the escrow is important. In\na cash deal, it’s easy—it’s cash. However, in a stock deal or a deal that\nhas a combination of cash and stock, the value of the escrow will"}
{"page": 204, "text": "Letters of Intent—The Other Term Sheet 189\nfloat with the stock price, and the value can vary even more dramati-\ncally over time if it’s private company stock. There are lots of permu-\ntations on how to best manage this on the seller side; you should be\nespecially thoughtful about this if you have concerns that the buyer’s\nstock is particularly volatile. Imagine the situation where the stock\nprice declines but the buyer’s escrow claims are of greater value than\nthe stock in escrow represents. Reasonable people should be able to\nagree that the seller doesn’t have to come up with extra money to\nsatisfy the claims.\nConfidentiality/Nondisclosure Agreement\nWhile VCs will almost never sign nondisclosure agreements (NDAs)\nin the context of an investment, NDAs are almost always mandatory\nin an acquisition. If the deal falls apart and ultimately doesn’t hap-\npen, both parties (the seller and the buyer) are left in a position\nwhere they have sensitive information regarding the other. Further-\nmore, it’s typically one of the few legally binding provisions in an\nLOI other than the location of jurisdiction for any legal issues and\nbreakup fees. If the deal closes, this provision largely becomes irrel-\nevant since the buyer now owns the seller.\nBoth the buyer and the seller should be aligned in their desire\nto have a comprehensive and strong confidentiality agreement\nsince both parties benefit. If you are presented with a weak (or one-\nsided) confidentiality agreement, it could mean that the acquirer is\nattempting to learn about your company through the due diligence\nprocess and may or may not be intent on closing the deal.\nGenerally, a one-sided confidentiality agreement makes no\nsense—this should be a term that both sides are willing to sign up to\nwith the same standard. Public companies are often very particular\nabout the form of the confidentiality agreement. While we don’t rec-\nommend sellers sign just anything, if it’s bidirectional you are prob-\nably in a pretty safe position.\nEmployee Matters\nAlthough the board of a company has a fiduciary responsibility to\nall employees and shareholders of a company, it’s unfortunately not\nalways the case that management and the board are looking out\nfor all employees and all shareholders in an acquisition. In public\ncompany acquisitions you often hear about egregious cases of senior"}
{"page": 205, "text": "190 Venture Deals\nmanagement looking out for themselves (and their board members\nhelping them line their pockets) at the expense of shareholders.\nThis can also happen in acquisitions of private companies, where\nthe buyer knows it needs the senior executives to stick around and\nis willing to pay something extra for it. Of course, the opposite can\nhappen as well, where the consideration in an acquisition is slim and\nthe investors try to grab all the nickels for themselves, leaving man-\nagement with little or nothing.\nIt’s important for management and the board to have the proper\nperspective on their individual circumstances in the context of the\nspecific deal that is occurring. Whenever we are on the board of\na company that is a seller, we prefer to defer the detailed discus-\nsion about individual compensation until after the LOI is signed\nand the managements of the buyer and the seller have time to do\ndue diligence on each other, build a working relationship, and\nunderstand the logical roles of everyone going forward. Spending\ntoo much time up front negotiating management packages often\nresults in a lot of very early deal fatigue, typically makes buyers\nuncomfortable with the motivation of the management team for\nthe sale, and can often create a huge wedge between management\nand the other shareholders on the seller’s side. We aren’t suggest-\ning that management and employees shouldn’t be taken care of\nappropriately in a transaction; rather, we believe there won’t be\nan opportunity to take care of everyone appropriately if you don’t\nactually get to the transaction. Overnegotiating this too early often\ncauses a lot of unnecessary stress, especially between management\nand their investors.\nWhile we don’t recommend negotiating the employment agree-\nments too early in the process, we also don’t recommend leaving\nthem to the very end of the process. Many buyers do this so they can\nexert as much pressure as possible on the key employees of the seller\nas everyone is ready to get the deal done, and the only thing hanging\nit up is the employment agreements. Ironically, many sellers view the\nsituation exactly the opposite way (i.e., now that the deal is basically\ndone, we can ask for a bunch of extra stuff from the buyer). Neither\nof these positions is very effective, and both usually result in unnec-\nessary tension at the end of the deal process and occasionally create\na real rift between buyer and seller post transaction.\nThis is a particular situation where balance is important. When\nit comes to employee matters, there’s nothing wrong with a solid"}
{"page": 206, "text": "Letters of Intent—The Other Term Sheet 191\nnegotiation. Just make sure that it happens in the context of a deal\nor you may never actually get the deal done.\nConditions to Close\nBuyers normally include certain conditions to closing in the LOI.\nThese can be generic phrases such as “Subject to Board approval by\nAcquirer,” “Subject to the Company not having a material adverse\nchange,” or “Subject to due diligence and agreement on defi nitive\ndocuments.” There can also be phrases that are specifi c to the sit-\nuation of the seller such as “Subject to the Company settling out-\nstanding copyright litigation,” or “Subject to Company liquidating\nits foreign subsidiaries.” We generally don’t get too concerned about\nthis provision, because any of these deal outs are very easy to trigger\nshould the buyer decide that it doesn’t want to do the deal.\nInstead of worrying about whether the provision is part of the\nLOI, we tend to focus on the details of the conditions to close since\nthis is another data point about the attitude of the buyer. If the list\nof conditions is long and complex, you likely have a suitor with very\nparticular tastes. In this case it’s worth pushing back early on a few of\nthese conditions to close, especially the more constraining ones, to\nlearn about what your negotiation process is going to be like.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nRemember, once buyers are in a signifi cant legal and due diligence process\nwith you, they are as emotionally and fi nancially committed to a deal as you are\n(and in many cases, their reputation is on the line, too).\nAs the seller, you should expect that once you’ve agreed to spe-\ncifi c conditions to close, you will be held to them. It’s worth address-\ning these early in the due diligence process so you don’t get hung up\nby something unexpected when you have to liquidate a foreign sub-\nsidiary or some other bizarre condition to close, especially if you’ve\nnever done this before.\nThe No-Shop Clause\nSigning a letter of intent starts a serious and expensive process for\nboth the buyer and the seller. As a result, you should expect that a\nbuyer will insist on a no-shop provision similar to the one that we"}
{"page": 207, "text": "192 Venture Deals\ndiscussed around term sheets. In the case of an acquisition, no-shop\nprovisions are almost always unilateral, especially if you are dealing\nwith an acquisitive buyer.\nAs the seller you should be able to negotiate the length of time\ninto a reasonable zone such as 45 to 60 days. If the buyer is asking\nfor more than 60 days, you should push back hard since it’s never in\na seller’s interest to be locked up for an extended period of time. In\naddition, most deals should be able to be closed within 60 days from\nsigning of the LOI, so having a reasonable deadline forces everyone\nto be focused on the actual goal of closing the deal.\nSince most no-shop agreements will be unilateral, the buyer will\ntypically have the right but not the obligation to cancel the no-shop\nif it decides not to go forward with the deal. As a result, the time win-\ndow is particularly important since the seller is likely to be tied up for\nthe length of the no-shop even if the deal doesn’t proceed. In some\ncases an honorable buyer who has decided not to move forward with\na deal will quickly agree to terminate the no-shop; however, it’s more\nlikely that the buyer will simply drag its feet until the no-shop expires.\nIn cases in which the deal is actively in process and the no-shop\nperiod ends, the seller should expect a call from the buyer a few\ndays before the expiration of the no-shop with a request to extend\nit. There is often some additional leverage that accrues to the seller\nat this moment in time, including relief from a net worth threshold,\npotential short-term fi nancing from the buyer, or even very specifi c\nconcessions around reps and warranties that have been held up in\nthe negotiation. The seller should be careful not to overreach at this\nmoment since the tone for the fi nal phase of the negotiation can be\nset by the behavior around the extension of the no-shop. If the seller\nasks for too much at this point in time, it can expect the buyer to\ntighten down on everything else through the close of the deal.\nRather than fi ght the no-shop, we’ve found it more effective\nto limit the duration of the no-shop period and carve out specifi c\nevents, most notably fi nancings (at the minimum fi nancings done by\nthe existing syndicate), to keep some pressure on the buyer.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nAs with no-shops with VCs, no-shops with potential buyers should also have an\nautomatic out if the buyer terminates the process."}
{"page": 208, "text": "Letters of Intent—The Other Term Sheet 193\nFees, Fees, and More Fees\nThe LOI will usually be explicit about who pays for which costs and\nwhat limits exist for the seller to run up transaction costs in the\nacquisition. Transaction costs associated with an agent or a banker,\nthe legal bill, and any other seller-side costs are typically included in\nthe transaction fee section. Though it’s conceivable that the buyer\nwill punt on worrying about who covers transaction fees, most savvy\nbuyers are very focused on making sure the seller ends up eating\nthese, especially if they are meaningful amounts.\nOccasionally, the concept of a breakup fee comes up for situ-\nations where the deal doesn’t close or the seller ends up doing a\ndeal with another buyer. Breakup fees are rare in private company\nVC-backed deals but prevalent in deals where one public company\nacquires another public company. We generally resist any request of\na buyer to institute a breakup fee and tell the potential buyer to rely\non the no-shop clause instead. Most buyers of VC-backed companies\nare much larger and more resource rich than the seller it seeks to\nacquire, so it strikes us as odd that the buyer would receive a cash\nwindfall if the deal does not close, especially since both parties will\nhave costs incurred in the process. When we are the seller, we rarely\nask for a breakup fee.\nThe Entrepreneur’s Perspective\nThere are some rare circumstances in which a seller can reasonably ask for\na breakup fee. If the buyer is competitive and the seller is concerned that the\nbuyer may be entering the process as a fi shing expedition as opposed to a\ngood-faith effort to buy the company, or if the seller incurs a massive amount\nof customer or employee risk by entering into the deal, a breakup fee may\nbe appropriate.\nRegistration Rights\nWhen a public company is buying a private company for stock, it’s\nimportant for the seller to understand the registration characteris-\ntics and rights associated with the stock it will be receiving. Some\nbuyers will try to ignore this; a good seller should work hard up front\nto get agreement on what it will be receiving. Just because a company\nis public doesn’t mean all of their stock is tradable on a stock market."}
{"page": 209, "text": "194 Venture Deals\nIf you are receiving stock in an acquisition, you’ll often receive unreg-\nistered stock that will need to be registered before you can sell it.\nIf the buyer offers unregistered stock, it should come with a\npromise to register the shares. It’s important that the seller recog-\nnize that this is almost always a nonbinding promise since the buyer\ncan’t guarantee when it can register the shares because it is depen-\ndent on the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for this and\nit doesn’t control the SEC. The past history of the buyer with the\nSEC is crucial, including knowing the current status of SEC filings,\nany outstanding registration statements, and any promises that the\nbuyer has made to shareholders of other companies it has acquired.\nWe’ve experienced several cases in which buyers promised a\nquick registration only to drag their feet on the filing after the deal\nor have the filing get hung up at the SEC. In today’s regulatory envi-\nronment, we’ve been amazed by the poor behavior of several of the\nlarge accounting firms when they state they don’t have time to work\non acquisition accounting questioned by the SEC, especially in situ-\nations in which the accounting firm is not going to be working with\nthe acquirer after the acquisition.\nPursuant to securities laws, if you receive unregistered stock and\nhold it for a year, then you can sell it on the stock market on which\nthe company is listed.

There are terms such as managing the escrow,\ndealing with earn-outs, working capital adjustments, and even litiga-\ntion concerning reps and warranties that will last long into the future.\nIn every acquisition, there is someone—referred to as the shareholder\nrepresentative—who is appointed to be the representative of all the\nformer shareholders in the seller to deal with these issues.\nThis lucky person, who is generally not paid anything for his ser-\nvices, gets to deal with all the issues that arise between the buyer and\nthe seller after the transaction. These issues can be based around\nbuyer’s remorse or be legitimate issues, and are often time consum-\ning and expensive to deal with, and impact the ultimate financial\noutcome of the deal."}
{"page": 210, "text": "Letters of Intent—The Other Term Sheet 195\nTraditionally, either an executive from the seller or one of the\nVC board members takes on this role. If nothing ever comes up, it’s a\ncomplete nonevent for this person. However, when something goes\nawry where the buyer makes a claim on the escrow or threatens to\nsue the former shareholders of the company, this job often becomes\na giant time-wasting nightmare. The shareholder rep, who typically\nhas a full-time job, limited money from the deal (often tied up in the\nescrow) to hire professionals to help her, and usually isn’t a subject\nmatter expert in anything that is at issue, ends up being responsible\nfor dealing with it.

If nothing else, this works to be a good shield to a bad-acting\nbuyer since it will see that you have money to hire lawyers to yell at\nits lawyers.\nNever ask someone who will be working for the buyer post\ntransaction to be the shareholder rep. If you do this, you are ask-\ning this person to get into a winner-takes-all fight against his current\nemployer, and that is not a happy position for anyone to be in. The\nonly time this ever works is if the shareholder rep has a role that is\ncritical to the buyer where the threat of the rep quitting will help\ninfluence the outcome in a way positive to the seller. Regardless, this\nis a stressful and uncomfortable position to be in.\nYou should also be wary of letting a VC take on this role. Escrow\nand litigation dynamics are time sensitive, and we’ve had experi-\nences where other VCs involved as the shareholder rep paid little or\nno attention to their responsibilities since they didn’t fully under-\nstand or appreciate the legal dynamics surrounding their role.\nWe’ve had some bizarre experiences, including a shareholder rep"}

{"page": 213, "text": "198 Venture Deals\nif we di dn’t have legal documents to protect their investment. Our\nauditors would have nothing to look at to ensure we are getting what\nwe paid for and are valuing our portfolio correctly. Furthermore,\nthere are a few extreme cases out there where these documents were\nimportant constraints to bad behavior. Typically, courts will not give\nVCs any benefit of the doubt in contract negotiations so if we want a\nprovision, we have to get it clearly and explicitly in writing.\nAlong these lines, we thought it might be helpful to give you\nthe theories of why contracts like these exist. Properly drafted docu-\nments should help the parties align incentives so that each desires\nto act in ways that are beneficial to one another. Following are some\ngeneral themes of what makes a contract truly useful in a relation-\nship and should serve as a framework when you consider particular\nprovisions in a contract. Once again, we thank our friend Brad\nBernthal (CU Law Professor) for his suggestions.\nConstraining Behavior and the Alignment of Incentives\nAny good contractual relationship strives to be a win/win situation\nfor both parties, where each party is incentivized to act in each\nother’s best interests. Many things can drive this. It could be the\nbusiness relationship is so important to both parties that every-\none will be a good actor. There can be reputational constraints\ninvolved. However, neither of these have any legal teeth to make\nsure everyone behaves. So contracts were developed to make sure\nthat if something went awry, good behavior, to some extent, would\nbe enforceable.\nWhile it’s nice to think that people are generous of spirt, it’s a fact\nof life that most people, especially in a business context, are driven\nby self-interest. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but it’s helpful to\nalways keep this in mind. If you assume that your VC will do what is\nbest for both of you and it happens that these actions actually make\nyou both better off, then the relationship should be a smooth one. If\none day you awaken and realize that you are not on the same page,\nthen things can get interesting. For instance, remember the section\nin the previous chapter around the treatment of stock options in an\nacquisition. In this situation, there are numerous ways that you, your\nVCs, and your employees will have radically different self-interests.\nWhat benefits one group will directly adversely affect the others.\nOr consider the situation of a capped liquidation preference with"}
{"page": 214, "text": "Why Do Term Sheets Even Exist? 199\nparticipation. Again, at the time of a sale of the business, the parties\nmay not be aligned.\nWe always suggest that you deal with things like this openly and\ndirectly. Ultimately, if you can’t reach an agreement on how to address\nthem, the situation will be bounded by the contractual terms that\nyou have agreed to beforehand. Because of this, it is critical to think\nabout how term sheets and contracts constrain bad behavior and align\nincentives.\nAs we’ve discussed, the only two things that really matter in a\nterm sheet are economic and control provisions. We could have\nsaid that the only two things that matter are making sure incentives\nwere aligned and that potential bad behavior is mitigated, but that\nwould be too academic for real life. However, keep in mind that the\nconstructs are analogous. Whenever you are trying to figure out if a\nparticular term is good or bad for you, consider how this will either\nproactively or negatively (through veto powers) decrease the ability\nfor people to behave poorly, or whether or not they improve the\nalignment of your incentives as well as your investors’. If something\nfeels out of whack and you think a particular provision divides you\nand your investor’s incentives, be very careful about accepting it. It’s\nin this vein that you have a very powerful negotiating tool. You don’t\nhave to say “I don’t want this term, it’s not market.” Instead, try the\napproach of “Wait a minute, this term starts the relationship by divid-\ning us and resulting in our incentives being misaligned.”\nOutside of these two considerations, every good contract should\ndeal effectively with transactions costs, agency costs, and information\nasymmetries, which we’ll discuss below.\nTransaction Costs\nThere are different definitions of transaction costs, but for our pur-\nposes they are the costs—in both time and money—associated with\ncreating a relationship between two parties. For instance, in closing\na venture deal between an entrepreneur and a VC, transaction costs\nwill include not only the costs of lawyers for both sides but also the\ncosts of meetings, the time involved to do due diligence upon one\nanother, and every step of the process from that first meeting to the\nsigned definitive documents.\nIf you go back 25 years, it was difficult to get your startup funded,\nnot just because there were fewer VCs, but because there were high"}
{"page": 215, "text": "200 Venture Deals\ntransaction costs to deal with. There were no standard forms of docu-\nments accepted by the industry, so lawyers spent a lot of time arguing\nabout things. There was no ubiquity of electronic communications.\nThis meant meetings were in-person meetings and hard to schedule.\nThere was no instant communication method. Furthermore, couri-\ners shuffled documents back and forth (Jason’s old law firm had bike,\ncar, and plane couriers staffed full time at the office). Thankfully,\ntechnology, transparency, and discussion online and in books like\nthis have dramatically lowered these costs. The dynamics of a financ-\ning is no longer a black box controlled by lawyers and a few knowl-\nedgeable investors.\nWhen entering a contractual relationship, consider that all good\ncontracts minimize current and future transaction costs. As we dis-\ncussed earlier, convertible debt became increasing popular due\nto the lower legal fees associated with it when compared to equity\nrounds. Fifteen years ago an equity financing cost four times that of\na convertible debt financing. Today, there isn’t much difference at\nall. When determining what structure to use to raise money for your\ncompany, consider what the transaction costs will be to get the deal\ndone.\nWe find future transaction costs to be even more important\nto consider. For instance, we suggest that you negotiate a detailed\nmerger letter of intent (LOI) before signing it in order to avoid\ntoo much negotiation ambiguity while drafting the definitive\ndocuments. As you have more negotiating power during the LOI\nstage, what would take two hours to negotiate now could save you\ntens of hours later. In short, you are defining the relationship up\nfront so that you don’t have to run up huge costs, both in time and\nmoney, figuring out who has which rights and who receives what\nconsideration.\nAgency Costs and Information Asymmetry\nAgency costs are costs associated with an agent acting on behalf of\na principal. Some of these costs are direct. If I hire a stockbroker to\nbuy stocks for me, I must also pay them a fee to complete the trade.\nSome of these costs are indirect and hard to spot.\nLet’s use the example of a walking dead portfolio company. This is a\ncompany that is still in business, but just limping along with no clear"}

It would probably be in the VC’s best interest if\nthe company shut down so the VC could recoup whatever money is\nleft in the bank account and take the tax loss.\nLet’s consider the VC the principal in the scenario. The CEO,\nhowever, has other incentives. He still has a decent salary and gets\nto walk around town with his CEO business card. His incentive is to\nkeep the company alive as long as possible. The CEO in this case is\nthe agent.\nRegardless of the amount of time the VC and the entrepreneur\nspends together, there is no way either party will know as much about\nthe other’s business—and motivation—as they know about their\nown. This information asymmetry, like agency dynamics, results in a\nmisalignment of incentives.\nConsider which contractual provisions could help alleviate\nthis conflict. A contractual right to a board seat for the VC would\nbe helpful. An odd number of board members, with at least one\nindependent board member, would be relevant. The VC having\nredemption rights, while not necessarily palatable to the CEO, pro-\nvides some additional pressure in the context of making a decision\nabout what to do. The idea of a liquidation preference, occasionally\nreferred to as schmuck insurance, is additional protection for the\ninvestor.\nReputation Constraints\nIf you are playing a long-term game, reputation constraints can be even\nmore important than a specific term in a contract. The venture indus-\ntry is small and reputation matters a lot. Bad behavior gets talked\nabout, even if it’s done quietly and not out in the open. The smaller\nthe ecosystem, the more this phenomenon exists, so as you focus on\nsmaller geographies, the importance of reputation increases.\nWhile there are some people who care less about their reputation\nthan others, your reputation will be established over a long period\nof time. While no contract is airtight, how you deal with ambiguity\nand conflict will help define your reputation. This impacts both\nentrepreneurs and investors. Do your homework and find out the\nreal reputation of the other party that you are dealing with. In some\nregards, this is the most important term of them all."}

While in some cases\nthey will simply be a hassle to clean up in a financing or an exit,\nthey often have meaningful financial implications for the company\nand, in the worst case, can seriously damage the value of your busi-\nness. We aren’t your lawyers or giving you legal advice here (our\nlawyers made us write that), but we encourage you to understand\nthese issues rather than just assume that your lawyer got them right.\nIf you want to read the best book ever written on legal issues that\nface entrepreneurs, get the book The Entrepreneur’s Guide to Business\nLaw, Fourth Edition, by Constance Bagley and Craig Dauchy (South-\nWestern, 2012). It is written for entrepreneurs, not lawyers, so it’s easily\ndigestible and is the best legal resource we know for entrepreneurs.\nIntellectual Property\nIntellectual property (IP) issues can kill a startup before you even\nreally begin. Following is an example.\nYou and a friend go out and get some beers. You start telling him\nabout your new company that will revolutionize X and make you a\nlot of money. You spend several hours talking about the business\nmodel, what you need to build, and the product requirements. After\none beer too many, you both stumble home happy.\n203"}
{"page": 218, "text": "204 Venture Deals\nYour friend goes back to work at his job at Company X-like. You\npicked this particular friend to vet your idea because you know that\nyour company is similar to some cutting-edge work he does at X-like.\nThere is even a chance that you’d want to hire this friend one day.\nYou spend the next six months bootstrapping your company and\nrelease a first version of your product. A popular tech blog writes\nabout it and you start getting inbound calls from venture capitalists\n(VCs) wanting to fund you. You can’t stop smiling and are excited\nabout how glorious life as an entrepreneur is.\nThe next day, your beer buddy calls and says that he’s been laid\noff from Company X-like and wants to join your company. You tell\nhim as soon as you get funding you’d love to hire him. Your friend\nsays, “That’s okay—I can start today for no pay since I own 50% of\nthe company.” You sit in stunned silence for a few seconds.\nAs you discuss the issue, your friend tells you that he owns 50%\nof the IP of your company since you guys went out and basically\nformed the company over beers. You tell him that you disagree\nand he doesn’t own any of the company. He tells you his uncle is\na lawyer.\nAs strange as this sounds, this is a real example. While we think\nthe claim by your so-called friend is ridiculous, if he takes action\n(via his uncle, who is likely working for him for free), he can slow\ndown your VC financing. If he stays after you and you don’t give him\nsomething, it’s possible that he’ll end up completely stifling your\nchance to raise money. If you happen to get lucky (for instance, if\nyour so-called friend accidentally gets hit by a bus), you still have the\noutstanding issue that Company X-like may also have a claim on the\nIP if there is an actual lawsuit filed and X-like happens to stumble\nupon piecing the story together.\nThere are endless stories like this in startup land, including the\nhistory of the founding of Facebook, popularized (and fictionalized)\nby the movie The Social Network. Our example is one extreme, but\nthere are others, like students starting a company in an MBA class\nwhere two go on to actually start the business while the other two\ndon’t, but terrorize the company for ownership rights later due to\ntheir claimed IP contributions. Or the entrepreneur who hired a\ncontractor to write code for him, paid the contractor, but still ended\nup in litigation with the contractor, who claimed he owned IP above\nand beyond what he was paid for. Realize that even if you pay for\ncode written by someone else, you don’t own the code unless you get"}

In our experience, there’s often a\nstraightforward resolution except in extreme circumstances.\nThe key is being careful, diligent, and reasonably paranoid up\nfront. When friends are involved, you can usually work this stuff out\nwith a simple conversation. However, when talking to random peo-\nple, be careful of unscrupulous characters, especially those you know\nnothing about.\nSome entrepreneurs, and many lawyers, think the right solution\nis to carefully guard your idea or have everyone you talk to sign a\nnondisclosure agreement (NDA). We don’t agree with this position.\nInstead, we encourage entrepreneurs to be very open with their\nideas, and we generally believe NDAs aren’t worth very much. How-\never, be conscious of whom you are talking to. If there are few repu-\ntational constraints to someone acting badly, then think hard before\ndisclosing your IP to them. If you do start heading down the path\nof actually creating a business, make sure you have competent legal\ncounsel help you document it.\nEmployment Issues\nThe most common lawsuits entrepreneurs face are ones around\nemployment issues. These are never pleasant, especially in the con-\ntext of an employee you’ve recently fired, but they are an unfortu-\nnate result of today’s work context.\nThere are a few things you can do to protect against this. First,\nmake sure that everyone you hire is an at-will employee. Without\nthese specific words in the offer letter, you can end up dealing with\nstate employment laws (which vary from state to state) that deter-\nmine whether you can fire someone. We’ve encountered some chal-\nlenging situations in certain states in the United States that made\nfiring almost as challenging as firing them in parts of Europe.\nNext, consider whether you want to prebake severance terms\ninto an offer letter. For instance, you might decide that if you let\nsomeone go, they will receive additional vesting or cash compensation."}
{"page": 220, "text": "206 Venture Deals\nIf you don’t decide this at the outset, you may be left with a situation\nwhere you are able to fire someone, but they claim that you owe\nthem something on the way out. However, determining up-front sev-\nerance is about as much fun as negotiating a prenuptial agreement,\nand the downside to it is that it limits your flexibility, especially if the\ncompany is in a difficult financial situation and needs to fire people\nto lower its burn rate in order to conserve cash to survive.\nEvery entrepreneur should know at least one good employment\nlawyer. Dealing with these particular issues can be stressful and unpre-\ndictable, especially given the extensive rules around discrimination\nthat again vary from state to state, and a knowledgeable employment\nlawyer can quickly help you get to an appropriate resolution when\nsomething comes up.\nState of Incorporation\nWhile you can incorporate your business in 50 states, there are a\nfew preferred states to incorporate in, especially when you are plan-\nning to seek VC backing. Most VCs prefer one of three states: Dela-\nware, whichever state the company is in, or whichever state the VC\nis located in.\nDelaware is common because corporate law for Delaware is\nwell defined and generally business friendly, and most lawyers in\nthe United States are adept at dealing with Delaware law. If you are\nplanning on ultimately having an initial public offering (IPO), most\ninvestment bankers will insist on your being incorporated in Dela-\nware before they will take you public. More importantly, lots of obvi-\nous things that are difficult or not permitted in some states, such as\nfaxed signature pages or rapid response to requests for changes in\ncorporate documents, are standard activities in Delaware.\nThe only two disadvantages of being incorporated in Delaware\nare that you will have to pay some extra (but very modest) taxes and\npotentially comply with two sets of corporate laws. For instance, if\nyou are located in California and are a Delaware corporation, you’ll\nhave to comply with Delaware law and some of California law, too,\ndespite being a Delaware corporation.\nEither of the other two common choices, the location of the\ncompany or the location of the VC, is generally fine also. However, if\na VC has no experience with your state’s corporate laws, you’ll occa-\nsionally find resistance for incorporating in your state. We view this"}
{"page": 221, "text": "Legal Things Every Entrepreneur Should Know 207\nas rational behavior on the part of the VC, especially when the VC\njoins the board because the VC then ends up being personally liable\nas a director under the state’s corporate laws. Since these laws can\nvary widely, we always encourage Delaware as the default case.\nType of Corporate Structure\nThere are three different corporate structures you can use for your\ncompany: a C Corp, S Corp, or an LLC. If you are going to raise\nventure capital, you will want to be a C Corp, but it’s useful to under-\nstand why and when you might benefit from the other corporation\nstructures.\nIf you are not going to raise any VC or angel money, an S Corp\nis the best structure as it has all the tax benefits and flexibility of a\npartnership—specifically a single tax structure versus the potential\nfor the double tax structure of a C Corp—while retaining the liability\nprotection of a C Corp.\nOften, an LLC (limited liability company) will substitute for\nan S Corp (it has similar dynamics), although it’s much harder to\neffectively grant equity to employees. Instead of stock options, LLCs\nuse membership units, which few employees have experience with.\nIn addition, stock options have better and more clearly defined tax\ndynamics. LLCs work well for companies with a limited number of\nowners. They don’t work as well when the ownership starts to be\nspread among multiple people.\nIf you are going to raise VC or angel money, a C Corp is the best\n(and often required) structure. In a VC-/angel-backed company,\nyou’ll almost always end up with multiple classes of stock, which are\nnot permitted in an S Corp. Since a VC-/angel-backed company is\nexpected to lose money for a while (in most cases that’s the expecta-\ntion for why you are raising money in the first place) the double taxa-\ntion issues will be deferred. In addition, it’s unlikely that you will be\ndistributing money out of a VC-/angel-backed company when you\nbecome profitable.\nAccredited Investors\nThough this isn’t a book about securities laws (which, if it were,\nwould make it a dreadfully dull book), much of it is actually about\nselling securities to investors. There are lots of laws that you need to"}
{"page": 222, "text": "208 Venture Deals\ncomply with in order to not get in trouble with the Securities and\nExchange Commission (SEC), and thus that is one of the major rea-\nsons that you need to have a good lawyer.\nWhen we wrote the prior editions of this book, it was illegal to\nsell securities to anyone you wanted to. Now, in a crowdfunding/\npost–JOBS Act world, you have many more options to whom you can\nsell equities to. Nonetheless, the vast majority of entrepreneurs are\nstill sticking with the old regime of selling to accredited investors.\nThere are laws that effectively say that only rich and sophisticated\npeople are accredited investors allowed to buy stock in private compa-\nnies. If you try to raise money from people who do not fit this defi-\nnition, then you’ve probably committed a securities violation. This\nmeans you should not ask your hairdresser, auto mechanic, and bag\nboy at the grocery store to buy stock in your company unless they\nare independently wealthy. Normally, the SEC doesn’t catch most\npeople who do this, but it does happen sometimes.\nIf you ignore this advice and sell stock in your private company\nto people who don’t fit the SEC’s definition of an accredited inves-\ntor, then you have a lifelong problem on your hands. Specifically,\nthese nonaccredited investors can force you to buy back their shares\nfor at least their purchase price anytime they want, despite how your\ncompany is doing. This right of rescission is a very real thing that we see\nfrom time to time. It is particularly embarrassing when the person\nforcing the buyback is a close family friend or relative who should\nnot have been offered the stock in the first place.\nFiling an 83(b) Election\nThis is another “if you don’t do it right in the beginning you can’t fix\nit later” issue. If you don’t file an 83(b) election within 30 days after\nreceiving your stock in a company, you will almost always lose capital\ngains treatment of your stock when you sell it. We refer to this as the\nmistake that will cause you to pay at least double the amount of taxes\nthat you should pay.\nThe 83(b) election is a simple form that takes two minutes to exe-\ncute. Most lawyers will provide the standard form as part of granting\nyour stock. Some will even provide a stamped and addressed enve-\nlope, and the most client-friendly lawyers will even mail the form for\nyou. Or you can just Google “83(b) election” and download the form\nyourself. Note that you must send the form to the appropriate IRS\nservice center."}
{"page": 223, "text": "Legal Things Every Entrepreneur Should Know 209\nIt’s a bummer when you are in the middle of an acquisition and\nyou realize the 83(b) election is unsigned under a pile of papers on\nyour desk. For a firsthand account of this, take a look at the chapter\ntitled “To 83(b) or Not to 83(b)” in Brad’s and David Cohen’s book\nDo More Faster (John Wiley & Sons, 2010).\nSection 409A Valuations\nOur last random legal topic that often rears its ugly head around an\nacquisition is Section 409A of the tax code, also known as the 409A\nvaluation. Section 409A says that all stock options given to employees\nof a company need to be at fair market value.\nIn the old days before the turn of the millennium (pre-409A),\nthe board of a private company could determine what the fair mar-\nket value of a share of common stock was and this was acceptable\nto the IRS. It became common practice that the share price for the\ncommon stock, which is also the exercise price for the stock options\nbeing granted, was typically valued at 10% of the price of the last\nround of preferred stock. The exception was when a company was\nwithin 18 months of an IPO, in which case the price of the common\nstock converged with the price of the preferred stock as the IPO\ndrew nearer.\nFor some reason the IRS decided this wasn’t the right way to\ndetermine fair market value, came up with a new approach in Sec-\ntion 409A of the tax code, and created dramatic penalties for the\nincorrect valuation of stock options. The penalties included excise\ntaxes on the employee and potential company penalties. In addition,\nsome states, such as California, instituted their own penalties at the\nstate level. When Section 409A was first drafted, it sounded like a\nnightmare.\nHowever, the IRS gave everyone a way out, also known through-\nout the legal industry as a safe harbor. If a company used a profes-\nsional valuation firm, the valuation would be assumed to be correct\nunless the IRS could prove otherwise, which is not an easy thing to\ndo. In contrast, if the company chose not to use a professional valu-\nation firm, then the company would have to prove the valuation was\ncorrect, which is also a hard thing to do.\nThe predictable end result of this was the creation of an entirely\nnew line of business for accountants and a bunch of new valuation\nfirms. Section 409A effectively created new overhead for doing\nbusiness that helped support the accounting profession. Although"}
{"page": 224, "text": "210 Venture Deals\nwe have a bunch of friends who work for 409A valuation firms, we\ndon’t believe that any of this is additive in any way to the company\nor to the value-creation process. Originally, these costs were about\n$5,000 to $15,000 per year. Recently, eShares announced that they’ll\ndo 409A valuations if a company signs up for a subscription fee as\nlittle as $25 per month depending on the size of the company. Either\nway, money spent here could easily be spent on something more use-\nful to the company, such as beer or search engine marketing.\nAn unfortunate side effect is that the 10% rule, where common\nstock was typically valued at 10% of the preferred stock, is no longer\nvalid. We often see 409A valuations in early-stage companies valuing\ncommon stock at 20% to 30% of the preferred stock. As a result,\nemployees make less money in a liquidity event, as options are more\nexpensive to purchase since their basis (or exercise price) is higher.\nIronically, the IRS also collects fewer taxes, as it receives tax only\non the value of the gain (sale price of the stock minus the exercise\nprice). In this case, the accountants are the only financial winners."}

These programs\ntypically invest a modest amount of money (around\n$20,000) in companies in exchange for a small amount\nof equity (typically 6%). In addition, some offer addi-\ntional financing of $100,000 or more in the form of a\nconvertible note. The companies then go through a\n90-day, intensive, full-time program where they acceler-\nate their startups via help from the accelerators, mentors,\nand the surrounding startup communities. Several years\nago, Techstars founded the Global Accelerator Network\n(www.gan.co) in an effort to link the best accelerators\nand provide a series of best practices across them.\nVentureDeals.com (www.venturedeals.com) This is the com-\npanion website for Venture Deals and is maintained by us.\nOn it we have a blog where we answer questions submit-\nted via the website as well as highlight great blog posts\nby other VCs.

In the current model, companies\nare effectively getting their customers to prepay for their\nproduct or service. In April 2012 in the United States, the\nJumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act was passed,\nwhich provides for equity crowdfunding, or the ability of a\ncompany to use the notion of crowdfunding to raise equity.\nDatabases A number of private company databases, includ-\ning Mattermark (www.mattermark.com) and Crunchbase\n(www.crunchbase.com) exist. Keep in mind that with all\nprivate company data, accuracy varies a lot, so you’ll find\nsome noise here, but in general the signal is high.

{"page": 246, "text": "Venture Deals: Be Smarter than Your Lawyer\nand Venture Capitalist, Third Edition\nBy Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson\nCopyright © 2016 by Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson\nForeword to the First and Second Editions\nI\nwish I’d had this book when I started my first company. At\nthe time, I didn’t know preferred stock from chicken stock and\nthought a right of first refusal was something that applied to the\nNFL waiver wire.\nToday, as the CEO of Twitter and the founder of three previous\ncompanies, the latter two acquired by public companies and the first\nacquired by a private company, I’ve learned many of the concepts\nand lessons in this book the hard way. While I had some great inves-\ntors and advisers along the way, I still had to figure out all the tricks,\ntraps, and nuances on my own.\nMy partners in my first company—Burning Door Networked\nMedia—and I were novices, so we made a lot of mistakes, but we man-\naged to sell the company in 1996 for enough money to keep ourselves\nknee-deep in Starbucks tall coffees every morning for a year.\nSeveral years later, my partners at Burning Door and I started a\nnew company called Spyonit. This company did better and was sold\nto a public company called 724 Solutions in September 2000. Our\nstock was tied up for a year (we weren’t that tuned into registration\nrights at the time) and when we got our hands on the stock in mid-\nSeptember 2001, the collapse of the Internet bubble and the finan-\ncial aftermath of 9/11 had caused our stock to decline to the point\nthat it was worth enough money to keep us knee-deep in tall skim\nlattes at Starbucks every morning for a year.\nSo, like all good entrepreneurs, we tried again. This time, armed\nwith a lot more knowledge and humility, we started FeedBurner in\n2004. We raised several rounds of venture capital, including a seed\nround from DFJ Portage, a Series A round from Mobius Venture\n235"}
{"page": 247, "text": "236 Foreword to the First and Second Editions\nCapital (the firm Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson were part of at\nthe time) and Sutter Hill, and a Series B round from Union Square\nVentures. FeedBurner grew quickly, and before we knew it we had\nattracted acquisition interest from several companies, including\nGoogle, which purchased us in 2007 and allowed me to stop using\ncoffee-purchase analogies to quantify the payout.\nAfter spending several years at Google, I was recruited to join\nTwitter, where I now am the CEO. During my tenure with the com-\npany, Twitter has grown dramatically, from 50 people to more than\n430 people, and has completed two major rounds of financing, hav-\ning raised over $250 million.\nWhen I reflect back on what I now know about VC deals, acqui-\nsitions, how VCs work, and how to negotiate, it’s very satisfying to\nsee how far I’ve come from that day back in the early 1990s when I\ncofounded Burning Door Networked Media. When I read through\nthis book, I kept thinking over and over, “Where were you when I\nstarted out?” as the knowledge contained between these covers\nwould have saved me a remarkable amount of time and money on\nmy journey.\nBrad and Jason have written a book that is hugely important for\nany aspiring entrepreneurs, students, and first-time entrepreneurs.\nBut it’s not just limited to them—as I read through it I found new\npearls of wisdom that even with all the experience I have today I can\nput to good use. And if you are a VC or aspire to be a VC, get in the\nfront of the line to read this to make sure you are armed with a full\nrange of understanding of the dynamics of your business. Finally, if\nyou are a lawyer who does these deals for a living, do yourself a favor\nand read this also, if only to be armed with things to use to torture\nyour adversaries.\nDick Costolo\nTwitter CEO\nMarch 2011"}

First,\nhowever, I’ll discuss the three historical frameworks that have been used to\ndescribe why some cities become vibrant startup communities.\nHISTORICAL FRAMEWORKS\nThe investigation into startup communities is among the most important\ninquiries of our time. Why do some places flourish with innovation while\nothers wither? What are the determinants that help a startup community\nachieve critical startup mass? Once under way, how does a startup commu-\nnity sustain and expand entrepreneurship? Why do startup communities\npersist, despite often having higher real estate costs and wages than other\n263"}
{"page": 274, "text": "STARTUP COMMUNITIES\nareas? At stake is nothing less than the continued economic vitality, and\neven the very existence of towns, cities, and regions.\nStudies show that the geography of innovation is neither democratic\nnor flat. This may be surprising since you might think that location should\nmatter less than ever in today’s society. Information can be quickly sent and\nreceived by anyone from almost anywhere. In theory, expanding access to\nresources and information from anywhere might decouple the relationship\nbetween place and innovation.\nEconomic geographers, however, observe the opposite effect. Evidence\nsuggests that location, rather than being irrelevant, is more important\nthan ever. Innovation tilts heavily toward certain locations and, as scholar\nRichard Florida (professor at Rotman School of Management, at the\nUniversity of Toronto and author of The Rise of the Creative Class (2002))\nsays, is “spiky” with great concentration of creative, innovative people in\ntightly clustered geographies. Location clearly matters.\nThree prominent frameworks explain why some locales are hotbeds\nof entrepreneurship whereas others are the innovation equivalent of\na twenty-first century economic mirage. Each explanation of regional\nentrepreneurial advantage comes from a different discipline—one from\neconomics, another from sociology, and a third from geography. These\nexplanations are, for the most part, nonexclusive and complementary.\nThe first explanation, external or agglomeration economies, comes from\neconomics. This line of analysis reaches back to the research of economist\nAlfred Marshall, and, in recent decades, Michael Porter, Paul Krugman, and\nPaul Romer have deepened this account. External economies focus on the\nbenefits of startup concentration in an area. This explanation focuses on eco-\nnomic concepts as they apply to location. One is that companies co-located\nin an area benefit from “external economies of scale.” Emerging companies\nneed certain common inputs—for example, infrastructure, specialized legal\nand accounting services, suppliers, labor pools with a specialized knowledge\nbase—that reside outside the company. Companies in a common geographic\narea share the fixed costs of these resources external to the company. As\n264"}
{"page": 275, "text": "Principles of a Vibrant Startup Community\nmore and more startups in an area can share the costs of specialized inputs,\nthe average cost per startup drops for the specialized inputs. This provides\ndirect economic benefit to companies located within a startup community.\nAnother economic concept, network effects, explains why geographic\nconcentration yields further advantage. Network effects operate in systems\nwhere the addition of a member to a network enhances value for existing\nusers. The Internet, Facebook, and Twitter are examples in which network\neffects operate powerfully. These services may have some value to you if\nthere are just 100 other users. However, these networks are immensely\nmore useful if there are 100 million other users that you can connect with.\nStartup communities similarly feature strong network effects. For example,\nan area with 10 great programmers provides a valuable pool of labor talent\nfor a startup. However, an additional 1,000 amazing programmers in the\nsame area is vastly more valuable to startups, especially if programmers\nshare best practices with other programmers, inspire one another, or start\nnew companies. External economies of scale lower certain costs; mean-\nwhile, network effects make co-location more valuable.\nThe second explanation of startup communities, horizontal networks,\ncomes from sociology. In her PhD work at MIT, AnnaLee Saxenian\n(currently Dean of the UC Berkeley School of Information) noticed that\nexternal economies do not fully explain the development and adapta-\ntion of startup communities. In particular, in her seminal book Regional\nAdvantage: Culture and Competition in Silicon Valley and Route 128 (1994)\nSaxenian noted that two hotbeds for high-tech activity—Silicon Valley\nand Boston’s Route 128—looked very similar in the mid-1980s. Each area\nenjoyed agglomeration economies associated with the nation’s two high-\ntech regions. Yet just a decade later, Silicon Valley gained a dominant\nadvantage over Route 128. External economies alone did not provide an\nanswer. Saxenian set out to resolve the puzzle of why Silicon Valley far\noutpaced Route 128 from the mid-1980s to mid-1990s.\nSaxenian persuasively argues that a culture of openness and information\nexchange fueled Silicon Valley’s ascent over Route 128. This argument is tied\n265"}
{"page": 276, "text": "STARTUP COMMUNITIES\nto network effects, which are better leveraged by a community with a culture\nof information sharing across companies and industries. Saxenian observed\nthat the porous boundaries between Silicon Valley companies, such as Sun\nMicrosystems and HP, stood in stark contrast to the closed-loop and autar-\nkic companies of Route 128, such as DEC and Apollo. More broadly, Silicon\nValley culture embraced a horizontal exchange of information across and\nbetween companies. Rapid technological disruption played perfectly to\nSilicon Valley’s culture of open information exchange and labor mobility.\nAs technology quickly changed, the Silicon Valley companies were better\npositioned to share information, adopt new trends, leverage innovation,\nand nimbly respond to new conditions. Meanwhile, vertical integration and\nclosed systems disadvantaged many Route 128 companies during periods of\ntechnological upheaval. Saxenian highlights the role of a densely networked\nculture in explaining Silicon Valley’s successful industrial adaptation as com-\npared to Route 128.\nFinally, the third explanation of startup communities, the notion of\nthe creative class, comes from geography. Richard Florida describes the\ntie between innovation and creative-class individuals. The creative class\nis composed of individuals such as entrepreneurs, engineers, professors,\nand artists who create “meaningful new forms.” Creative-class individuals,\nFlorida argues, want to live in nice places, enjoy a culture with a toler-\nance for new ideas and weirdness, and—most of all—want to be around\nother creative-class individuals. This is another example of network effects,\nbecause a virtuous cycle exists where the existence of a creative class in\nan area attracts more creative-class individuals to the area, which in turn\nmakes the area even more valuable and attractive. A location that hits criti-\ncal mass enjoys a competitive geographic advantage over places that have\nyet to attract a significant number of creative-class individuals.\nEach of the three explanations just outlined provides a useful lens\nto understand why the entrepreneurial world has concentrations of\nstartup communities in specific geographies. They are incomplete, how-\never, concerning how to put a startup community into motion. There is a\n266"}
{"page": 277, "text": "Principles of a Vibrant Startup Community\nserious chicken and egg problem; although it is not difficult to see why\ninnovation havens have an advantage, it is more challenging to explain\nhow to get a startup community up and running.\nTHE BOULDER THESIS\nI suggest a fourth framework based on our experience in Boulder. Let’s call\nit the Boulder Thesis. This framework has four key components:\n1. Entrepreneurs must lead the startup community.\n2. The leaders must have a long-term commitment.\n3. The startup community must be inclusive of anyone who wants to\nparticipate in it.\n4. The startup community must have continual activities that engage\nthe entire entrepreneurial stack.\nLED BY ENTREPRENEURS\nThe most critical principle of a startup community is that entrepreneurs\nmust lead it. Lots of different people are involved in the startup community\nand many nonentrepreneurs play key roles. Unless the entrepreneurs lead,\nthe startup community will not be sustainable over time.\nIn virtually every major city, there are long lists of different types of peo-\nple and organizations who are involved in the startup community including\ngovernment, universities, investors, mentors, and service providers. His-\ntorically, many of these organizations try to play a leadership role in the\ndevelopment of their local startup community. Although their involvement\nis important, they can’t be the leaders. The entrepreneurs have to be leaders.\nI define an entrepreneur as someone who has co-founded a company. I\ndifferentiate between “high-growth entrepreneurial companies” and “small\n267"}
{"page": 278, "text": "STARTUP COMMUNITIES\nbusinesses.” Both are important, but they are different things. Entrepre-\nneurial companies have the potential to be or are high-growth businesses\nwhereas small businesses tend to be local, profitable, but slow-growth\norganizations. Small-business people are often “pillars of their commu-\nnity” as their businesses have a tight co-dependency with their community.\nBy contrast, founders of high-growth entrepreneurial companies generally\nare involved in the local community as employers and indirect contribu-\ntors to small businesses and the local economy, but they rarely are involved\nin the broad business community because they are extraordinarily focused\non their companies.\nBecause of this intense focus, it’s unrealistic to think that all entrepre-\nneurs in a community will be leaders. All that is needed is a critical mass of\nentrepreneurs, often less than a dozen, who will provide leadership.\nLONG-TERM COMMITMENT\nThese leaders have to make a long-term commitment to their startup com-\nmunity. I like to say this has to be at least 20 years from today to reinforce\nthe sense that this has to be meaningful in length. Optimally, the commit-\nment resets daily; it should be a forward-looking 20-year commitment.\nIt’s well understood that economies run in cycles. Economies grow,\npeak, decline, bottom out, grow again, peak again, decline again, and bot-\ntom out again. Some of these cycles are modest. Some are severe. The\nlengths vary dramatically.\nStartup communities have to take a very long-term view. A great\nstartup community such as Silicon Valley (1950–today) has a long trajec-\ntory. Although they have their booms and busts, they continued to grow,\ndevelop, and expand throughout this period of time.\nMost cities and their leaders get excited about entrepreneurship after\na major economic decline. They focus on it for a few years through a peak.\nWhen the subsequent decline ultimately happens, they focus on other\n268"}
{"page": 279, "text": "Principles of a Vibrant Startup Community\nthings during the downturn. When things bottom out, most of the progress\ngained during the upswing was lost. I’ve seen this several times—first in the\nearly 1990s and again around the Internet bubble. All you have to do is think\nback to the nickname of your city during the Internet bubble (Silicon Alley,\nSilicon Swamp, Silicon Slopes, Silicon Prairie, Silicon Gulch, and Silicon\nMountain) to remember what it was like before and after the peak.\nThis is why the leaders have to first be entrepreneurs and then have a\nlong-term view. These leaders must be committed to the continuous devel-\nopment of their startup community, regardless of the economic cycle their\ncity, state, or country is in. Great entrepreneurial companies, such as Apple,\nGenentech, Microsoft, and Intel, were started during down economic cycles.\nIt takes such a long time to create something powerful that, almost by defi-\nnition, you’ll go through several economic cycles on the path to glory.\nIf you aspire to be a leader of your startup community, but you aren’t\nwilling to live where you are for the next 20 years and work hard at lead-\ning the startup community for that period of time, ask yourself what your\nreal motivation for being a leader is. Although you can have impact for\na shorter period of time, it’ll take at least this level of commitment from\nsome leaders to sustain a vibrant startup community.\nFOSTER A PHILOSOPHY OF INCLUSIVENESS\nA startup community must be extremely inclusive. Anyone who wants to\nengage should be able to, whether they are changing careers, moving\nto your city, graduating from college, or just want to do something differ-\nent. This applies to entrepreneurs, people who want to work for startups,\npeople who want to work with startups, or people who are simply intellec-\ntually interested in startups.\nThis philosophy of inclusiveness applies at all levels of the startup com-\nmunity. The leaders have to be open to having more leaders involved, recog-\nnizing that leaders need to be entrepreneurs who have a long-term view of\n269"}
{"page": 280, "text": "STARTUP COMMUNITIES\nbuilding their startup community. Entrepreneurs in the community need\nto welcome other entrepreneurs, viewing the growth of the startup com-\nmunity as a positive force for all, rather than a zero-sum game in which\nnew entrepreneurs compete locally for resources and status. Employees of\nstartups need to recruit their friends and open their homes and city to\nother people who have moved into the community.\nEveryone in the startup community should have a perspective that\nhaving more people engaged in the startup community is good for the\nstartup community. Building a startup community is not a zero-sum game\nin which there are winners and losers; if everyone engages, they and the\nentire community can all be winners.\nENGAGE THE ENTIRE ENTREPRENEURIAL STACK\nStartup communities must have regular activities that engage the entire\nentrepreneurial stack. This includes first-time entrepreneurs, experienced\nentrepreneurs, aspiring entrepreneurs, investors, mentors, employees of\nstartups, service providers to startups, and anyone else who wants to be\ninvolved.\nOver the years, I’ve been to many entrepreneurial award events, peri-\nodic cocktail parties, monthly networking events, panel discussions, and\nopen houses. Although these types of activities have a role, typically in shin-\ning a bright light on the people doing good things within the startup com-\nmunity, they don’t really engage anyone in any real entrepreneurial activity.\nThe emergence of hackathons, new tech meetups, open coffee clubs,\nstartup weekends, and accelerators like TechStars stand out in stark con-\ntrast. These are activities and events, which I will cover in depth later in\nthis book, that last from a few hours to three months and provide a tan-\ngible, focused, set of activities for the members of the startup community\nto engage in. By being inclusive of the startup community, these activities\nconsistently engage the entire entrepreneurial stack.\n270"}
{"page": 281, "text": "Principles of a Vibrant Startup Community\nSome of these activities will last for decades; others will go strong for\na few years and then fade away; others will fail to thrive and die quickly.\nThis dynamic is analogous to startups—it’s okay to try things that fail, and\nthe startup community must recognize when something isn’t working\nand move on. The leaders of the failed activity should try again to cre-\nate things that engage the entire entrepreneurial stack, and participants in\nfailed activities should keep on engaging in stuff, recognizing that they are\nplaying a long-term game.\n271"}
